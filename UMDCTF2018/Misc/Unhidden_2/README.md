# Unhidden 2 
We were recently made aware of a privacy preserving Hidden Service located at: `umdctfafwe62b6tb.onion`, but we have a feeling that it is leaking sensitive information! Can you discover the true IP address of the Hidden Service? Once found, submit the flag in standard flag format at: `UMDCTF-{111.222.333.444}`, where `111.222.333.444` is the IPv4 address of the Hidden Service. Good luck!
