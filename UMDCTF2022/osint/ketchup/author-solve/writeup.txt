This challenge depends on the use of a facial recognition site and a reverse
image searcher. images.google.com is not strong enough for either task.

1) Use pimeyes.com to find facial matches on the web. tineyes.com does not work
for this image, but can often be used in similar scenarios.

2) After matches are returned, inspect the source code of the webpage to get
the source image of the first match.

3) Save the image from the link above, and reverse image search with it.
images.google.com does not work, so a better alternative is needed. I used
https://yandex.com/images/ and got a successful match.

4) View the first match to find the person's name.
