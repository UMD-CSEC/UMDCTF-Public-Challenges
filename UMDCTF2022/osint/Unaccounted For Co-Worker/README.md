Help! My co-worker hasn't showed up to work for the past week and my boss wants me to find out where he went. I know that 
he took an American Airlines flight from the "Mile High City" to the city with the largest historic theatre district (both 
are international airports) on February 24th. A couple days later, I heard he took a train northwest 7 stops. Can you tell 
me the aircraft type and the final destination city?
