Blue Star Accounting
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Blue Star Software has recently hired a new intern to write an accounting program. The intern specified
that they were new to C/C++ and would do their best! In a mad rush to meet deadlines, the intern
accidentally pushed an extremely buggy version of the program to prduction :-0

As the intern's supervisor, you need to exploit the program and retrieve the flag in order to
remove the buggy accounting program from production and save Blue Star Software's reputation!

You've been given a copy of the latest file pushed to the repo. Use this for your RE purposes in order
to develop your exploit. Once you are confident, connect to the production server and retreive the flag!

The production server can be reached at (ip, port)

This flag follows the standard format.
