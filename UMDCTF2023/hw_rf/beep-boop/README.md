## Build Instructions

 1. Run `build.m` with `flag.txt` in matlab!

## Files for CTFd

 - `sound.wav`
 - `build.m`

## Flag

`UMDCTF{do_you_actually_enjoy_signal_processing_???}`

## Writeup

In the build file (`build.m`), we can see that `sound.wav` is generated by encoding each character from the flag into a unique audio tone of two frequencies. These two functions determine those frequencies:
```
function freq = get_frequency_1(char)
	freq = char * 13;
end

function freq = get_frequency_2(char)
	freq = (char - 50) * 11;
end
```

With this knowledge in mind, it becomes possible to reverse-engineer the flag by mapping each tone in `sound.wav` back to a character! 

(For reference, this is what `sound.wav` looks like)

The process essentially works like this:

 1. Separate each tone out of `sound.wav`
 2. For each individual tone, find its magnitude plot.
 3. The magnitude plot will contain both, unique frequencies used to generate the tone. By remapping one of those frequencies back into a character, we can decipher our flag!

This solution is illustrated in `solve.m`:

%=======================
%We first define the lengths of:
%   -The initial gap before sound begins (INITIAL_GAP)
%   -The size of each tone (TONE_SIZE)
%   -The size of each soundless gap between tones (GAP_SIZE)
%These defintions are in terms of vector indicies. Run plot(sound) to find
%them!
INITIAL_GAP = 2031;
TONE_SIZE = 8202;
GAP_SIZE = 4094;
%=======================

%Read our sound as a vector (an array of values). "Fs" represents the
%sampling rate of 8192.
[sound, Fs] = audioread("sound.wav");

%Let the variable "i" take us through the sound vector. 
%We set it to INITIAL_GAP to skip the leading whitespace in our sound.wav.
i = INITIAL_GAP; 
reading_tone = 1; %The first thing we read will be a tone, not whitespace.
characters_decyphered = 0;

%Iterate through the sound vector
while i < length(sound) - TONE_SIZE
    if reading_tone %Check if we are about to read a tone. If not, skip to the next one.

        %Seperate our tone from the rest of our sound. Let this tone be a
        %smaller array called "s".
        s = sound(i : i + TONE_SIZE); 

        N = length(s);
        k = 0 : N-1;
        F = (k / N) * Fs;

        S = abs(fft(s)); %Get the DFT of our tone. We only care about its magnitude

        S_half = S(1 : round(N / 2)); %Cut off the upper half of the magnitude plot

        %Now, get the strongest frequency from our magnitude plot. 
        %Although each individual character is encoded into a tone with TWO
        %frequencies, we only need to look at one of the frequencies in
        %order to figure out which character the tone refers to.
        [y, freq] = max(S_half);

        %The frequency corresponds to a character within our flag. The two
        %lines below map the frequency back to a character. Since there's
        %no guarentee which frequency appears FIRST in our magnitude plot,
        %we need to consider both mappings
        char_1 = char(get_char_from_frequency_1_mapping(freq));
        char_2 = char(get_char_from_frequency_2_mapping(freq));
        
        %Finally, display char_1 and char_2. One of these will be a
        %character belonging to our flag. It should be easy to know which one
        %since the other character will appear
        %as garbage. 
        disp("Char #" + characters_decyphered + ": " + char_1 + char_2);

        %Increment our variables
        i = i + TONE_SIZE - GAP_SIZE;
        characters_decyphered = characters_decyphered + 1;
    end

    reading_tone = ~reading_tone; %Prepare ourselves to skip the whitespace trailing each tone
    i = i + GAP_SIZE;
end

disp(characters_decyphered + " characters found!")

function char = get_char_from_frequency_1_mapping(freq)
    char = round(freq / 13);
end

function char = get_char_from_frequency_2_mapping(freq)
    char = round(freq / 11) + 50;
