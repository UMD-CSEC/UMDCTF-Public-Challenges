# Detective Pikachu 2
Detective Pikachu is investigating the murder of a trainer in the Sinnoh region! Can you help him find out who did it?

Great job recovering access to the Sinnoh Murder Dossier.

Luckily our perp doesn't seem to be as skilled at sabotage and data manipulation as they claim.

Using what we have from the recovered dossier, can you help Detective Pikachu regain access to his system
and recover the rest of the lost case files? With this, he should be able to find out who commited the
crime!
