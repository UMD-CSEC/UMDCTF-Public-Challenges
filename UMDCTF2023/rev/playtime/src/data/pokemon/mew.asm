; Mew's pics and base data are not grouped with the other Pok√©mon
; because it was a last-minute addition "as a kind of prank".
; Shigeki Morimoto explained in an Iwata Asks interview:
; "We put Mew in right at the very end. The cartridge was really full and
; there wasn't room for much more on there. Then the debug features which
; weren't going to be included in the final version of the game were removed,
; creating a miniscule 300 bytes of free space. So we thought that we could
; slot Mew in there. What we did would be unthinkable nowadays!"
