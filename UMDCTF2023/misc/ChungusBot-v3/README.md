# ChungusBot v3
Team Rocket told me CBC-MAC with arbitrary-length messages is safe from forgery. I don't think they can be trusted, so I built this oracle for it to be tested before I use it for my own important needs. 

## Build Instructions
It is currently running on `Test CTFBot` server on the UMDCSEC bots droplet. The following actions need to be completed at the start of UMDCTF2023:
- ChungusBot v3 repo needs to go public
- ChungusBot v3 needs to be added to UMDCTF 2023 server 

## Files for CTFd
none

## Flag
