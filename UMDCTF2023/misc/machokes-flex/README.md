# Machoke's Flex
Machoke is flexing so hard I can't seem to take my eyes off of him. Wait... Where's the flag?

## Build Instructions
You need to get `ma.h` from the Google Drive and plop it in src (it contains the Machoke model lol). Make a build folder and cd into it and run `cmake ..`. Then run `cmake --build .`. The binary is in bin.

## Files for CTFd

## Flag
