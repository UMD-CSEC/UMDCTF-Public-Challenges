# CBC-MAC 1
Team Rocket told me CBC-MAC with arbitrary-length messages is safe from forgery. I don't think they can be trusted, so I built this oracle for it to be tested before I use it for my own important needs. 

## Build Instructions
Just need to run `python3 cbc-mac1.py`

## Files for CTFd
- cbc-mac1.py

## Flag
`UMDCTF{Th!s_M@C_Sch3M3_1s_0nly_S3cur3_f0r_f!xed_l3ngth_m3ss4g3s_78232813}`
