# CBC-MAC 2
Okay so I came up with a scheme that might just work. Definitely not trusting those TR peeps anymore. I'm not sure how to prove the security of this besides jsut having you test it again.

## Build Instructions
Just need to run `python3 cbc-mac2.py`

## Files for CTFd
- cbc-mac2.py

## Flag
`UMDCTF{W3lp_l00k5_l!k3_I_n33d_t0_ch4ng3_th1s_ag41n_s4d_f4ce_3m0j1_927323}`
