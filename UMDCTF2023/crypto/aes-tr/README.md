# AES-TR
Team Rocket came up with their own symmetric encryption scheme they claim is "top-notch". I told 'em they should release the details of the scheme due to Kirchoff's Principle, however I received an oracle instead. Let's prove that this scheme is definitely not IND-CPA secure.

## Build Instructions
Just need to run `python3 aes-tr.py`!

## Files for CTFd
- aes-tr.py

## Flag
`UMDCTF{N0t_@_v3ry_gr34t_5ch3m3_8ae61b7910099}`
