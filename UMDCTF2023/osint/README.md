## TCC challenges
The website is located [here](/tcc/website) with a Dockerfile if you so wish to build.

## Gone Missing challenges
The website is located [here](/geosint). Please note that you may need to supply your own Google Maps API key,
which is used in `chall.html`. If you click on a challenge and it shows a blank screen or a Google error message,
it probably means the API key is wrong or isn't active/working.

**NOTE:** I (itsecgary) am going to be hosting the gone missing challenges [here](https://osint.golf) at some point.
