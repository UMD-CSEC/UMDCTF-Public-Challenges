# remove this if your challenge has no online component
# this default config will build the container using the
# Dockerfile in the current directory
#
# also: see example Dockerfile in chall-template
# feel free to replace with your own, but if making a simple challenge
# w/ nc connetion it's a good start

# remove this if your challenge has no online component

# set these to true when your challenge is ready
# if you want to test your challenge, set deployed: true only, but
