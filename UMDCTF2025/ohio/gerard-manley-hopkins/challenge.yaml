  as kingfishers catch fire, dragonflies draw flame; as tumbled over rim in roundy wells stones ring; like each tucked string tells, each hung bell's bow swung finds tongue to fling out broad its name; each mortal thing does one thing and the same: deals out that being indoors each one dwells; selves - goes itself; myself it speaks and spells, crying what i do is me: for that i came. i say more: the just man justices; keeps grace: that keeps all his goings graces; acts in god's eye what in god's eye he is - christ - for christ plays in ten thousand places, lovely in limbs, and lovely in eyes not his to the father through the feature of men's faces.

  sorry i just really like poetry. what road are we on?
