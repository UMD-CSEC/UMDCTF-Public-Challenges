# Prison Realm

## Description

As the pwner inputted a series of A's to trigger a segfault, the binary knew it was almost time to take action. But it could not do this without enabling a stack canary. Thus, the pwner asked the binary, are you the strongest because you are the binary? Or are you the binary because you are the strongest? The binary simply replied, Nah, I'd win, for unbeknownst to the pwner, the binary could use the domain expansion: ASLR and the cursed techniques NX and PIE. In that moment, the binary believe it would truly not be exploited. But it didn't know two key things:

1) Always bet on the pwner.

2) The binary had an address leak bypassing ASLR.
