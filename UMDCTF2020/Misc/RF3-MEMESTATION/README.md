# RF3-MEMESTATION

(Note: Due to the current circumstances, "iq files" will substitute for the intended live radio challenge transmissions at UMDCTF. These files can be imported into various radio tools, and effectively simulate what you would've received during the in-person competition. All iq files can be found [here](https://ter.ps/umdctfRF)) 

For this challenge, you'll want to use `RF3-MEMESTATION.iq` and have [GNUradio](https://www.gnuradio.org/) installed.

Have you ever wondered how cars know what the name of the song playing on the radio is? I sure have...

For this challenge, you'll also want to install a pre-existing `gr-something` tool to rx ;)
