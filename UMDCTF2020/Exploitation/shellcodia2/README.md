# Shellcodia2

Welcome back to shellcodia! You know the drill. Simply connect, submit your shellcode in binary form, and if you've completed the challenge then a flag will return. This challenge requires you to create a file named 'strange.txt' and put the string 'awesome' inside. Now, a few things to remember, these are x64 machines so don't think you can sneak by with 32bit shellcode. Additionally, the environment assumes nothing about the shellcode you give it. It's highly unlikely that if you break the environment, even if you accomplished the goal, you will get the flag. Good luck!
