Enter HOSTESS and SLY

Christopher Sly. I'll pheeze you, in faith.
Hostess. A pair of stocks, you rogue!
Christopher Sly. Y'are a baggage; the Slys are no rogues. Look in the
chronicles: we came in with Richard Conqueror. Therefore, paucas5
pallabris; let the world slide. Sessa!
Hostess. You will not pay for the glasses you have burst?
Christopher Sly. No, not a denier. Go by, Saint Jeronimy, go to thy cold bed
and warm thee.
Hostess. I know my remedy; I must go fetch the third-borough.10
Exit

Christopher Sly. Third, or fourth, or fifth borough, I'll answer him by law.
I'll not budge an inch, boy; let him come, and kindly.
[Falls asleep]
Wind horns. Enter a LORD from hunting, with his train15
Lord. Huntsman, I charge thee, tender well my hounds;
Brach Merriman, the poor cur, is emboss'd;
And couple Clowder with the deep-mouth'd brach.
Saw'st thou not, boy, how Silver made it good
At the hedge corner, in the coldest fault?20
I would not lose the dog for twenty pound.
First Huntsman. Why, Belman is as good as he, my lord;
He cried upon it at the merest loss,
And twice to-day pick'd out the dullest scent;
Trust me, I take him for the better dog.25
Lord. Thou art a fool; if Echo were as fleet,
I would esteem him worth a dozen such.
But sup them well, and look unto them all;
To-morrow I intend to hunt again.
First Huntsman. I will, my lord.30
Lord. What's here? One dead, or drunk?
See, doth he breathe?
Second Huntsman. He breathes, my lord. Were he not warm'd with ale,
This were a bed but cold to sleep so soundly.
Lord. O monstrous beast, how like a swine he lies!35
Grim death, how foul and loathsome is thine image!
Sirs, I will practise on this drunken man.
What think you, if he were convey'd to bed,
Wrapp'd in sweet clothes, rings put upon his fingers,
A most delicious banquet by his bed,40
And brave attendants near him when he wakes,
Would not the beggar then forget himself?
First Huntsman. Believe me, lord, I think he cannot choose.
Second Huntsman. It would seem strange unto him when he wak'd.
Lord. Even as a flatt'ring dream or worthless fancy.45
Then take him up, and manage well the jest:
Carry him gently to my fairest chamber,
And hang it round with all my wanton pictures;
Balm his foul head in warm distilled waters,
And burn sweet wood to make the lodging sweet;50
Procure me music ready when he wakes,
To make a dulcet and a heavenly sound;
And if he chance to speak, be ready straight,
And with a low submissive reverence
Say 'What is it your honour will command?'55
Let one attend him with a silver basin
Full of rose-water and bestrew'd with flowers;
Another bear the ewer, the third a diaper,
And say 'Will't please your lordship cool your hands?'
Some one be ready with a costly suit,60
And ask him what apparel he will wear;
Another tell him of his hounds and horse,
And that his lady mourns at his disease;
Persuade him that he hath been lunatic,
And, when he says he is, say that he dreams,65
For he is nothing but a mighty lord.
This do, and do it kindly, gentle sirs;
It will be pastime passing excellent,
If it be husbanded with modesty.
First Huntsman. My lord, I warrant you we will play our part70
As he shall think by our true diligence
He is no less than what we say he is.
Lord. Take him up gently, and to bed with him;
And each one to his office when he wakes.
[SLY is carried out. A trumpet sounds]75
Sirrah, go see what trumpet 'tis that sounds-
[Exit SERVANT]
Belike some noble gentleman that means,
Travelling some journey, to repose him here.
[Re-enter a SERVINGMAN]80
How now! who is it?
Servant. An't please your honour, players
That offer service to your lordship.
Lord. Bid them come near.
Now, fellows, you are welcome.85
Players. We thank your honour.
Lord. Do you intend to stay with me to-night?
Player. So please your lordship to accept our duty.
Lord. With all my heart. This fellow I remember90
Since once he play'd a farmer's eldest son;
'Twas where you woo'd the gentlewoman so well.
I have forgot your name; but, sure, that part
Was aptly fitted and naturally perform'd.
Player. I think 'twas Soto that your honour means.95
Lord. 'Tis very true; thou didst it excellent.
Well, you are come to me in happy time,
The rather for I have some sport in hand
Wherein your cunning can assist me much.
There is a lord will hear you play to-night;100
But I am doubtful of your modesties,
Lest, over-eying of his odd behaviour,
For yet his honour never heard a play,
You break into some merry passion
And so offend him; for I tell you, sirs,105
If you should smile, he grows impatient.
Player. Fear not, my lord; we can contain ourselves,
Were he the veriest antic in the world.
Lord. Go, sirrah, take them to the buttery,
And give them friendly welcome every one;110
Let them want nothing that my house affords.
[Exit one with the PLAYERS]
Sirrah, go you to Bartholomew my page,
And see him dress'd in all suits like a lady;
That done, conduct him to the drunkard's chamber,115
And call him 'madam,' do him obeisance.
Tell him from me- as he will win my love-
He bear himself with honourable action,
Such as he hath observ'd in noble ladies
Unto their lords, by them accomplished;120
Such duty to the drunkard let him do,
With soft low tongue and lowly courtesy,
And say 'What is't your honour will command,
Wherein your lady and your humble wife
May show her duty and make known her love?'125
And then with kind embracements, tempting kisses,
And with declining head into his bosom,
Bid him shed tears, as being overjoyed
To see her noble lord restor'd to health,
Who for this seven years hath esteemed him130
No better than a poor and loathsome beggar.
And if the boy have not a woman's gift
To rain a shower of commanded tears,
An onion will do well for such a shift,
Which, in a napkin being close convey'd,135
Shall in despite enforce a watery eye.
See this dispatch'd with all the haste thou canst;
Anon I'll give thee more instructions. Exit a SERVINGMAN
I know the boy will well usurp the grace,
Voice, gait, and action, of a gentlewoman;140
I long to hear him call the drunkard 'husband';
And how my men will stay themselves from laughter
When they do homage to this simple peasant.
I'll in to counsel them; haply my presence
May well abate the over-merry spleen,145
Which otherwise would grow into extremes. Exeunt

Enter aloft SLY, with ATTENDANTS; some with apparel, basin and ewer, and other appurtenances; and LORD

Christopher Sly. For God's sake, a pot of small ale.
First Servant. Will't please your lordship drink a cup of sack?
Second Servant. Will't please your honour taste of these conserves?150
Third Servant. What raiment will your honour wear to-day?
Christopher Sly. I am Christophero Sly; call not me 'honour' nor 'lordship.' I
ne'er drank sack in my life; and if you give me any conserves,
give me conserves of beef. Ne'er ask me what raiment I'll wear,
for I have no more doublets than backs, no more stockings than155
legs, nor no more shoes than feet- nay, sometime more feet than
shoes, or such shoes as my toes look through the overleather.
Lord. Heaven cease this idle humour in your honour!
O, that a mighty man of such descent,
Of such possessions, and so high esteem,160
Should be infused with so foul a spirit!
Christopher Sly. What, would you make me mad? Am not I Christopher Sly, old
Sly's son of Burton Heath; by birth a pedlar, by education a
cardmaker, by transmutation a bear-herd, and now by present
profession a tinker? Ask Marian Hacket, the fat ale-wife of165
Wincot, if she know me not; if she say I am not fourteen pence on
the score for sheer ale, score me up for the lying'st knave in
Christendom. What! I am not bestraught. [Taking a pot of ale]
Here's-
Third Servant. O, this it is that makes your lady mourn!170
Second Servant. O, this is it that makes your servants droop!
Lord. Hence comes it that your kindred shuns your house,
As beaten hence by your strange lunacy.
O noble lord, bethink thee of thy birth!
Call home thy ancient thoughts from banishment,175
And banish hence these abject lowly dreams.
Look how thy servants do attend on thee,
Each in his office ready at thy beck.
Wilt thou have music? Hark! Apollo plays, [Music]
And twenty caged nightingales do sing.180
Or wilt thou sleep? We'll have thee to a couch
Softer and sweeter than the lustful bed
On purpose trimm'd up for Semiramis.
Say thou wilt walk: we will bestrew the ground.
Or wilt thou ride? Thy horses shall be trapp'd,185
Their harness studded all with gold and pearl.
Dost thou love hawking? Thou hast hawks will soar
Above the morning lark. Or wilt thou hunt?
Thy hounds shall make the welkin answer them
And fetch shall echoes from the hollow earth.190
First Servant. Say thou wilt course; thy greyhounds are as swift
As breathed stags; ay, fleeter than the roe.
Second Servant. Dost thou love pictures? We will fetch thee
straight
Adonis painted by a running brook,195
And Cytherea all in sedges hid,
Which seem to move and wanton with her breath
Even as the waving sedges play wi' th' wind.
Lord. We'll show thee Io as she was a maid
And how she was beguiled and surpris'd,200
As lively painted as the deed was done.
Third Servant. Or Daphne roaming through a thorny wood,
Scratching her legs, that one shall swear she bleeds
And at that sight shall sad Apollo weep,
So workmanly the blood and tears are drawn.205
Lord. Thou art a lord, and nothing but a lord.
Thou hast a lady far more beautiful
Than any woman in this waning age.
First Servant. And, till the tears that she hath shed for thee
Like envious floods o'er-run her lovely face,210
She was the fairest creature in the world;
And yet she is inferior to none.
Christopher Sly. Am I a lord and have I such a lady?
Or do I dream? Or have I dream'd till now?
I do not sleep: I see, I hear, I speak;215
I smell sweet savours, and I feel soft things.
Upon my life, I am a lord indeed,
And not a tinker, nor Christopher Sly.
Well, bring our lady hither to our sight;
And once again, a pot o' th' smallest ale.220
Second Servant. Will't please your Mightiness to wash your hands?
O, how we joy to see your wit restor'd!
O, that once more you knew but what you are!
These fifteen years you have been in a dream;
Or, when you wak'd, so wak'd as if you slept.225
Christopher Sly. These fifteen years! by my fay, a goodly nap.
But did I never speak of all that time?
First Servant. O, yes, my lord, but very idle words;
For though you lay here in this goodly chamber,
Yet would you say ye were beaten out of door;230
And rail upon the hostess of the house,
And say you would present her at the leet,
Because she brought stone jugs and no seal'd quarts.
Sometimes you would call out for Cicely Hacket.
Christopher Sly. Ay, the woman's maid of the house.235
Third Servant. Why, sir, you know no house nor no such maid,
Nor no such men as you have reckon'd up,
As Stephen Sly, and old John Naps of Greece,
And Peter Turph, and Henry Pimpernell;
And twenty more such names and men as these,240
Which never were, nor no man ever saw.
Christopher Sly. Now, Lord be thanked for my good amends!
All. Amen.
Enter the PAGE as a lady, with ATTENDANTS

Christopher Sly. I thank thee; thou shalt not lose by it.245
Page. How fares my noble lord?
Christopher Sly. Marry, I fare well; for here is cheer enough.
Where is my wife?
Page. Here, noble lord; what is thy will with her?
Christopher Sly. Are you my wife, and will not call me husband?250
My men should call me 'lord'; I am your goodman.
Page. My husband and my lord, my lord and husband;
I am your wife in all obedience.
Christopher Sly. I know it well. What must I call her?
Lord. Madam.255
Christopher Sly. Al'ce madam, or Joan madam?
Lord. Madam, and nothing else; so lords call ladies.
Christopher Sly. Madam wife, they say that I have dream'd
And slept above some fifteen year or more.
Page. Ay, and the time seems thirty unto me,260
Being all this time abandon'd from your bed.
Christopher Sly. 'Tis much. Servants, leave me and her alone.
[Exeunt SERVANTS]
Madam, undress you, and come now to bed.
Page. Thrice noble lord, let me entreat of you265
To pardon me yet for a night or two;
Or, if not so, until the sun be set.
For your physicians have expressly charg'd,
In peril to incur your former malady,
That I should yet absent me from your bed.270
I hope this reason stands for my excuse.
Christopher Sly. Ay, it stands so that I may hardly tarry so long. But I would be
loath to fall into my dreams again. I will therefore tarry in
despite of the flesh and the blood.
Enter a MESSENGER

Messenger. Your honour's players, hearing your amendment,
Are come to play a pleasant comedy;
For so your doctors hold it very meet,
Seeing too much sadness hath congeal'd your blood,
And melancholy is the nurse of frenzy.280
Therefore they thought it good you hear a play
And frame your mind to mirth and merriment,
Which bars a thousand harms and lengthens life.
Christopher Sly. Marry, I will; let them play it. Is not a comonty a
Christmas gambold or a tumbling-trick?285
Page. No, my good lord, it is more pleasing stuff.
Christopher Sly. What, household stuff?
Page. It is a kind of history.
Christopher Sly. Well, we'll see't. Come, madam wife, sit by my side and let
the world slip;-we shall ne'er be younger.290
[They sit down]

A flourish of trumpets announces the play

Enter LUCENTIO and his man TRANIO

Lucentio. Tranio, since for the great desire I had
To see fair Padua, nursery of arts,295
I am arriv'd for fruitful Lombardy,
The pleasant garden of great Italy,
And by my father's love and leave am arm'd
With his good will and thy good company,
My trusty servant well approv'd in all,300
Here let us breathe, and haply institute
A course of learning and ingenious studies.
Pisa, renowned for grave citizens,
Gave me my being and my father first,
A merchant of great traffic through the world,305
Vincentio, come of the Bentivolii;
Vincentio's son, brought up in Florence,
It shall become to serve all hopes conceiv'd,
To deck his fortune with his virtuous deeds.
And therefore, Tranio, for the time I study,310
Virtue and that part of philosophy
Will I apply that treats of happiness
By virtue specially to be achiev'd.
Tell me thy mind; for I have Pisa left
And am to Padua come as he that leaves315
A shallow plash to plunge him in the deep,
And with satiety seeks to quench his thirst.
Tranio. Mi perdonato, gentle master mine;
I am in all affected as yourself;
Glad that you thus continue your resolve320
To suck the sweets of sweet philosophy.
Only, good master, while we do admire
This virtue and this moral discipline,
Let's be no Stoics nor no stocks, I pray,
Or so devote to Aristotle's checks325
As Ovid be an outcast quite abjur'd.
Balk logic with acquaintance that you have,
And practise rhetoric in your common talk;
Music and poesy use to quicken you;
The mathematics and the metaphysics,330
Fall to them as you find your stomach serves you.
No profit grows where is no pleasure ta'en;
In brief, sir, study what you most affect.
Lucentio. Gramercies, Tranio, well dost thou advise.
If, Biondello, thou wert come ashore,335
We could at once put us in readiness,
And take a lodging fit to entertain
Such friends as time in Padua shall beget.
Enter BAPTISTA with his two daughters, KATHERINA
and BIANCA; GREMIO, a pantaloon; HORTENSIO,340
suitor to BIANCA. LUCENTIO and TRANIO stand by
But stay awhile; what company is this?
Tranio. Master, some show to welcome us to town.
Baptista Minola. Gentlemen, importune me no farther,
For how I firmly am resolv'd you know;345
That is, not to bestow my youngest daughter
Before I have a husband for the elder.
If either of you both love Katherina,
Because I know you well and love you well,
Leave shall you have to court her at your pleasure.350
Gremio. To cart her rather. She's too rough for me.
There, there, Hortensio, will you any wife?
Katherina. [To BAPTISTA] I pray you, sir, is it your will
To make a stale of me amongst these mates?
Hortensio. Mates, maid! How mean you that? No mates for you,355
Unless you were of gentler, milder mould.
Katherina. I' faith, sir, you shall never need to fear;
Iwis it is not halfway to her heart;
But if it were, doubt not her care should be
To comb your noddle with a three-legg'd stool,360
And paint your face, and use you like a fool.
Hortensio. From all such devils, good Lord deliver us!
Gremio. And me, too, good Lord!
Tranio. Husht, master! Here's some good pastime toward;
That wench is stark mad or wonderful froward.365
Lucentio. But in the other's silence do I see
Maid's mild behaviour and sobriety.
Peace, Tranio!
Tranio. Well said, master; mum! and gaze your fill.
Baptista Minola. Gentlemen, that I may soon make good370
What I have said- Bianca, get you in;
And let it not displease thee, good Bianca,
For I will love thee ne'er the less, my girl.
Katherina. A pretty peat! it is best
Put finger in the eye, an she knew why.375
Bianca. Sister, content you in my discontent.
Sir, to your pleasure humbly I subscribe;
My books and instruments shall be my company,
On them to look, and practise by myself.
Lucentio. Hark, Tranio, thou mayst hear Minerva speak!380
Hortensio. Signior Baptista, will you be so strange?
Sorry am I that our good will effects
Bianca's grief.
Gremio. Why will you mew her up,
Signior Baptista, for this fiend of hell,385
And make her bear the penance of her tongue?
Baptista Minola. Gentlemen, content ye; I am resolv'd.
Go in, Bianca. Exit BIANCA
And for I know she taketh most delight
In music, instruments, and poetry,390
Schoolmasters will I keep within my house
Fit to instruct her youth. If you, Hortensio,
Or, Signior Gremio, you, know any such,
Prefer them hither; for to cunning men
I will be very kind, and liberal395
To mine own children in good bringing-up;
And so, farewell. Katherina, you may stay;
For I have more to commune with Bianca. Exit
Katherina. Why, and I trust I may go too, may I not?
What! shall I be appointed hours, as though, belike,400
I knew not what to take and what to leave? Ha! Exit
Gremio. You may go to the devil's dam; your gifts are so good
here's none will hold you. There! Love is not so great,
Hortensio, but we may blow our nails together, and fast it fairly
out; our cake's dough on both sides. Farewell; yet, for the love405
I bear my sweet Bianca, if I can by any means light on a fit man
to teach her that wherein she delights, I will wish him to her
father.
Hortensio. So Will I, Signior Gremio; but a word, I pray. Though
the nature of our quarrel yet never brook'd parle, know now, upon410
advice, it toucheth us both- that we may yet again have access to
our fair mistress, and be happy rivals in Bianca's love- to
labour and effect one thing specially.
Gremio. What's that, I pray?
Hortensio. Marry, sir, to get a husband for her sister.415
Gremio. A husband? a devil.
Hortensio. I say a husband.
Gremio. I say a devil. Think'st thou, Hortensio, though her father
be very rich, any man is so very a fool to be married to hell?
Hortensio. Tush, Gremio! Though it pass your patience and mine to420
endure her loud alarums, why, man, there be good fellows in the
world, an a man could light on them, would take her with all
faults, and money enough.
Gremio. I cannot tell; but I had as lief take her dowry with this
condition: to be whipp'd at the high cross every morning.425
Hortensio. Faith, as you say, there's small choice in rotten
apples. But, come; since this bar in law makes us friends, it
shall be so far forth friendly maintain'd till by helping
Baptista's eldest daughter to a husband we set his youngest free
for a husband, and then have to't afresh. Sweet Bianca! Happy man430
be his dole! He that runs fastest gets the ring. How say you,
Signior Gremio?
Gremio. I am agreed; and would I had given him the best horse in
Padua to begin his wooing that would thoroughly woo her, wed her,
and bed her, and rid the house of her! Come on.435
Exeunt GREMIO and HORTENSIO

Tranio. I pray, sir, tell me, is it possible
That love should of a sudden take such hold?
Lucentio. O Tranio, till I found it to be true,
I never thought it possible or likely.440
But see! while idly I stood looking on,
I found the effect of love in idleness;
And now in plainness do confess to thee,
That art to me as secret and as dear
As Anna to the ~ueen of Carthage was-445
Tranio, I burn, I pine, I perish, Tranio,
If I achieve not this young modest girl.
Counsel me, Tranio, for I know thou canst;
Assist me, Tranio, for I know thou wilt.
Tranio. Master, it is no time to chide you now;450
Affection is not rated from the heart;
If love have touch'd you, nought remains but so:
'Redime te captum quam queas minimo.'
Lucentio. Gramercies, lad. Go forward; this contents;
The rest will comfort, for thy counsel's sound.455
Tranio. Master, you look'd so longly on the maid.
Perhaps you mark'd not what's the pith of all.
Lucentio. O, yes, I saw sweet beauty in her face,
Such as the daughter of Agenor had,
That made great Jove to humble him to her hand,460
When with his knees he kiss'd the Cretan strand.
Tranio. Saw you no more? Mark'd you not how her sister
Began to scold and raise up such a storm
That mortal ears might hardly endure the din?
Lucentio. Tranio, I saw her coral lips to move,465
And with her breath she did perfume the air;
Sacred and sweet was all I saw in her.
Tranio. Nay, then 'tis time to stir him from his trance.
I pray, awake, sir. If you love the maid,
Bend thoughts and wits to achieve her. Thus it stands:470
Her elder sister is so curst and shrewd
That, till the father rid his hands of her,
Master, your love must live a maid at home;
And therefore has he closely mew'd her up,
Because she will not be annoy'd with suitors.475
Lucentio. Ah, Tranio, what a cruel father's he!
But art thou not advis'd he took some care
To get her cunning schoolmasters to instruct her?
Tranio. Ay, marry, am I, sir, and now 'tis plotted.
Lucentio. I have it, Tranio.480
Tranio. Master, for my hand,
Both our inventions meet and jump in one.
Lucentio. Tell me thine first.
Tranio. You will be schoolmaster,
And undertake the teaching of the maid-485
That's your device.
Lucentio. It is. May it be done?
Tranio. Not possible; for who shall bear your part
And be in Padua here Vincentio's son;
Keep house and ply his book, welcome his friends,490
Visit his countrymen, and banquet them?
Lucentio. Basta, content thee, for I have it full.
We have not yet been seen in any house,
Nor can we be distinguish'd by our faces
For man or master. Then it follows thus:495
Thou shalt be master, Tranio, in my stead,
Keep house and port and servants, as I should;
I will some other be- some Florentine,
Some Neapolitan, or meaner man of Pisa.
'Tis hatch'd, and shall be so. Tranio, at once500
Uncase thee; take my colour'd hat and cloak.
When Biondello comes, he waits on thee;
But I will charm him first to keep his tongue.
Tranio. So had you need. [They exchange habits]
In brief, sir, sith it your pleasure is,505
And I am tied to be obedient-
For so your father charg'd me at our parting:
'Be serviceable to my son' quoth he,
Although I think 'twas in another sense-
I am content to be Lucentio,5~0
Because so well I love Lucentio.
Lucentio. Tranio, be so because Lucentio loves;
And let me be a slave t' achieve that maid
Whose sudden sight hath thrall'd my wounded eye.
[Enter BIONDELLO.]515
Here comes the rogue. Sirrah, where have you been?
Biondello. Where have I been! Nay, how now! where are you?
Master, has my fellow Tranio stol'n your clothes?
Or you stol'n his? or both? Pray, what's the news?
Lucentio. Sirrah, come hither; 'tis no time to jest,520
And therefore frame your manners to the time.
Your fellow Tranio here, to save my life,
Puts my apparel and my count'nance on,
And I for my escape have put on his;
For in a quarrel since I came ashore525
I kill'd a man, and fear I was descried.
Wait you on him, I charge you, as becomes,
While I make way from hence to save my life.
You understand me?
Biondello. I, sir? Ne'er a whit.530
Lucentio. And not a jot of Tranio in your mouth:
Tranio is chang'd into Lucentio.
Biondello. The better for him; would I were so too!
Tranio. So could I, faith, boy, to have the next wish after,
That Lucentio indeed had Baptista's youngest daughter.535
But, sirrah, not for my sake but your master's, I advise
You use your manners discreetly in all kind of companies.
When I am alone, why, then I am Tranio;
But in all places else your master Lucentio.
Lucentio. Tranio, let's go.540
One thing more rests, that thyself execute-
To make one among these wooers. If thou ask me why-
Sufficeth, my reasons are both good and weighty. Exeunt.
The Presenters above speak

First Servant. My lord, you nod; you do not mind the play.545
Christopher Sly. Yes, by Saint Anne do I. A good matter, surely; comes there
any more of it?
Page. My lord, 'tis but begun.
Christopher Sly. 'Tis a very excellent piece of work, madam lady
Would 'twere done! [They sit and mark]550

Petruchio. Verona, for a while I take my leave,
To see my friends in Padua; but of all
My best beloved and approved friend,
Hortensio; and I trow this is his house.555
Here, sirrah Grumio, knock, I say.
Grumio. Knock, sir! Whom should I knock?
Is there any man has rebus'd your worship?
Petruchio. Villain, I say, knock me here soundly.
Grumio. Knock you here, sir? Why, sir, what am I, sir, that I560
should knock you here, sir?
Petruchio. Villain, I say, knock me at this gate,
And rap me well, or I'll knock your knave's pate.
Grumio. My master is grown quarrelsome. I should knock you first,
And then I know after who comes by the worst.565
Petruchio. Will it not be?
Faith, sirrah, an you'll not knock I'll ring it;
I'll try how you can sol-fa, and sing it.
[He wrings him by the ears]

Grumio. Help, masters, help! My master is mad.570
Petruchio. Now knock when I bid you, sirrah villain!
Enter HORTENSIO

Hortensio. How now! what's the matter? My old friend Grumio and my
good friend Petruchio! How do you all at Verona?
Petruchio. Signior Hortensio, come you to part the fray?575
'Con tutto il cuore ben trovato' may I say.
Hortensio. Alla nostra casa ben venuto,
Molto honorato signor mio Petruchio.
Rise, Grumio, rise; we will compound this quarrel.
Grumio. Nay, 'tis no matter, sir, what he 'leges in ~atin. If this580
be not a lawful cause for me to leave his service- look you, sir:
he bid me knock him and rap him soundly, sir. Well, was it fit
for a servant to use his master so; being, perhaps, for aught I
see, two and thirty, a pip out?
Whom would to God I had well knock'd at first,585
Then had not Grumio come by the worst.
Petruchio. A senseless villain! Good Hortensio,
I bade the rascal knock upon your gate,
And could not get him for my heart to do it.
Grumio. Knock at the gate? O heavens! Spake you not these words590
plain: 'Sirrah knock me here, rap me here, knock me well, and
knock me soundly'? And come you now with 'knocking at the gate'?
Petruchio. Sirrah, be gone, or talk not, I advise you.
Hortensio. Petruchio, patience; I am Grumio's pledge;
Why, this's a heavy chance 'twixt him and you,595
Your ancient, trusty, pleasant servant Grumio.
And tell me now, sweet friend, what happy gale
Blows you to Padua here from old Verona?
Petruchio. Such wind as scatters young men through the world
To seek their fortunes farther than at home,600
Where small experience grows. But in a few,
Signior Hortensio, thus it stands with me:
Antonio, my father, is deceas'd,
And I have thrust myself into this maze,
Haply to wive and thrive as best I may;605
Crowns in my purse I have, and goods at home,
And so am come abroad to see the world.
Hortensio. Petruchio, shall I then come roundly to thee
And wish thee to a shrewd ill-favour'd wife?
Thou'dst thank me but a little for my counsel,610
And yet I'll promise thee she shall be rich,
And very rich; but th'art too much my friend,
And I'll not wish thee to her.
Petruchio. Signior Hortensio, 'twixt such friends as we
Few words suffice; and therefore, if thou know615
One rich enough to be Petruchio's wife,
As wealth is burden of my wooing dance,
Be she as foul as was Florentius' love,
As old as Sibyl, and as curst and shrewd
As Socrates' ~an~hippe or a worse-620
She moves me not, or not removes, at least,
Affection's edge in me, were she as rough
As are the swelling Adriatic seas.
I come to wive it wealthily in Padua;
If wealthily, then happily in Padua.625
Grumio. Nay, look you, sir, he tells you flatly what his mind is.
Why, give him gold enough and marry him to a puppet or an
aglet-baby, or an old trot with ne'er a tooth in her head, though
she has as many diseases as two and fifty horses. Why, nothing
comes amiss, so money comes withal.630
Hortensio. Petruchio, since we are stepp'd thus far in,
I will continue that I broach'd in jest.
I can, Petruchio, help thee to a wife
With wealth enough, and young and beauteous;
Brought up as best becomes a gentlewoman;635
Her only fault, and that is faults enough,
Is- that she is intolerable curst,
And shrewd and froward so beyond all measure
That, were my state far worser than it is,
I would not wed her for a mine of gold.640
Petruchio. Hortensio, peace! thou know'st not gold's effect.
Tell me her father's name, and 'tis enough;
For I will board her though she chide as loud
As thunder when the clouds in autumn crack.
Hortensio. Her father is Baptista Minola,645
An affable and courteous gentleman;
Her name is Katherina Minola,
Renown'd in Padua for her scolding tongue.
Petruchio. I know her father, though I know not her;
And he knew my deceased father well.650
I will not sleep, Hortensio, till I see her;
And therefore let me be thus bold with you
To give you over at this first encounter,
Unless you will accompany me thither.
Grumio. I pray you, sir, let him go while the humour lasts. O' my655
word, and she knew him as well as I do, she would think scolding
would do little good upon him. She may perhaps call him half a
score knaves or so. Why, that's nothing; and he begin once, he'll
rail in his rope-tricks. I'll tell you what, sir: an she stand
him but a little, he will throw a figure in her face, and so660
disfigure her with it that she shall have no more eyes to see
withal than a cat. You know him not, sir.
Hortensio. Tarry, Petruchio, I must go with thee,
For in Baptista's keep my treasure is.
He hath the jewel of my life in hold,665
His youngest daughter, beautiful Bianca;
And her withholds from me, and other more,
Suitors to her and rivals in my love;
Supposing it a thing impossible-
For those defects I have before rehears'd-670
That ever Katherina will be woo'd.
Therefore this order hath Baptista ta'en,
That none shall have access unto Bianca
Till Katherine the curst have got a husband.
Grumio. Katherine the curst!675
A title for a maid of all titles the worst.
Hortensio. Now shall my friend Petruchio do me grace,
And offer me disguis'd in sober robes
To old Baptista as a schoolmaster
Well seen in music, to instruct Bianca;680
That so I may by this device at least
Have leave and leisure to make love to her,
And unsuspected court her by herself.
Enter GREMIO with LUCENTIO disguised as CAMBIO
Grumio. Here's no knavery! See, to beguile the old folks, how the685
young folks lay their heads together! Master, master, look about
you. Who goes there, ha?
Hortensio. Peace, Grumio! It is the rival of my love. Petruchio,
stand by awhile.
Grumio. A proper stripling, and an amorous!690
[They stand aside]

Gremio. O, very well; I have perus'd the note.
Hark you, sir; I'll have them very fairly bound-
All books of love, see that at any hand;
And see you read no other lectures to her.695
You understand me- over and beside
Signior Baptista's liberality,
I'll mend it with a largess. Take your paper too,
And let me have them very well perfum'd;
For she is sweeter than perfume itself700
To whom they go to. What will you read to her?
Lucentio. Whate'er I read to her, I'll plead for you
As for my patron, stand you so assur'd,
As firmly as yourself were still in place;
Yea, and perhaps with more successful words705
Than you, unless you were a scholar, sir.
Gremio. O this learning, what a thing it is!
Grumio. O this woodcock, what an ass it is!
Petruchio. Peace, sirrah!
Hortensio. Grumio, mum! [Coming forward]710
God save you, Signior Gremio!
Gremio. And you are well met, Signior Hortensio.
Trow you whither I am going? To Baptista Minola.
I promis'd to enquire carefully
About a schoolmaster for the fair Bianca;715
And by good fortune I have lighted well
On this young man; for learning and behaviour
Fit for her turn, well read in poetry
And other books- good ones, I warrant ye.
Hortensio. 'Tis well; and I have met a gentleman720
Hath promis'd me to help me to another,
A fine musician to instruct our mistress;
So shall I no whit be behind in duty
To fair Bianca, so beloved of me.
Gremio. Beloved of me- and that my deeds shall prove.725
Grumio. And that his bags shall prove.
Hortensio. Gremio, 'tis now no time to vent our love.
Listen to me, and if you speak me fair
I'll tell you news indifferent good for either.
Here is a gentleman whom by chance I met,730
Upon agreement from us to his liking,
Will undertake to woo curst Katherine;
Yea, and to marry her, if her dowry please.
Gremio. So said, so done, is well.
Hortensio, have you told him all her faults?735
Petruchio. I know she is an irksome brawling scold;
If that be all, masters, I hear no harm.
Gremio. No, say'st me so, friend? What countryman?
Petruchio. Born in Verona, old Antonio's son.
My father dead, my fortune lives for me;740
And I do hope good days and long to see.
Gremio. O Sir, such a life with such a wife were strange!
But if you have a stomach, to't a God's name;
You shall have me assisting you in all.
But will you woo this wild-cat?745
Petruchio. Will I live?
Grumio. Will he woo her? Ay, or I'll hang her.
Petruchio. Why came I hither but to that intent?
Think you a little din can daunt mine ears?
Have I not in my time heard lions roar?750
Have I not heard the sea, puff'd up with winds,
Rage like an angry boar chafed with sweat?
Have I not heard great ordnance in the field,
And heaven's artillery thunder in the skies?
Have I not in a pitched battle heard755
Loud 'larums, neighing steeds, and trumpets' clang?
And do you tell me of a woman's tongue,
That gives not half so great a blow to hear
As will a chestnut in a farmer's fire?
Tush! tush! fear boys with bugs.760
Grumio. For he fears none.
Gremio. Hortensio, hark:
This gentleman is happily arriv'd,
My mind presumes, for his own good and ours.
Hortensio. I promis'd we would be contributors765
And bear his charge of wooing, whatsoe'er.
Gremio. And so we will- provided that he win her.
Grumio. I would I were as sure of a good dinner.
Enter TRANIO, bravely apparelled as LUCENTIO, and BIONDELLO
Tranio. Gentlemen, God save you! If I may be bold,770
Tell me, I beseech you, which is the readiest way
To the house of Signior Baptista Minola?
Biondello. He that has the two fair daughters; is't he you mean?
Tranio. Even he, Biondello.
Gremio. Hark you, sir, you mean not her to-775
Tranio. Perhaps him and her, sir; what have you to do?
Petruchio. Not her that chides, sir, at any hand, I pray.
Tranio. I love no chiders, sir. Biondello, let's away.
Lucentio. [Aside] Well begun, Tranio.
Hortensio. Sir, a word ere you go.780
Are you a suitor to the maid you talk of, yea or no?
Tranio. And if I be, sir, is it any offence?
Gremio. No; if without more words you will get you hence.
Tranio. Why, sir, I pray, are not the streets as free
For me as for you?785
Gremio. But so is not she.
Tranio. For what reason, I beseech you?
Gremio. For this reason, if you'll know,
That she's the choice love of Signior Gremio.
Hortensio. That she's the chosen of Signior Hortensio.790
Tranio. Softly, my masters! If you be gentlemen,
Do me this right- hear me with patience.
Baptista is a noble gentleman,
To whom my father is not all unknown,
And, were his daughter fairer than she is,795
She may more suitors have, and me for one.
Fair Leda's daughter had a thousand wooers;
Then well one more may fair Bianca have;
And so she shall: Lucentio shall make one,
Though Paris came in hope to speed alone.800
Gremio. What, this gentleman will out-talk us all!
Lucentio. Sir, give him head; I know he'll prove a jade.
Petruchio. Hortensio, to what end are all these words?
Hortensio. Sir, let me be so bold as ask you,
Did you yet ever see Baptista's daughter?805
Tranio. No, sir, but hear I do that he hath two:
The one as famous for a scolding tongue
As is the other for beauteous modesty.
Petruchio. Sir, sir, the first's for me; let her go by.
Gremio. Yea, leave that labour to great Hercules,810
And let it be more than Alcides' twelve.
Petruchio. Sir, understand you this of me, in sooth:
The youngest daughter, whom you hearken for,
Her father keeps from all access of suitors,
And will not promise her to any man815
Until the elder sister first be wed.
The younger then is free, and not before.
Tranio. If it be so, sir, that you are the man
Must stead us all, and me amongst the rest;
And if you break the ice, and do this feat,820
Achieve the elder, set the younger free
For our access- whose hap shall be to have her
Will not so graceless be to be ingrate.
Hortensio. Sir, you say well, and well you do conceive;
And since you do profess to be a suitor,825
You must, as we do, gratify this gentleman,
To whom we all rest generally beholding.
Tranio. Sir, I shall not be slack; in sign whereof,
Please ye we may contrive this afternoon,
And quaff carouses to our mistress' health;830
And do as adversaries do in law-
Strive mightily, but eat and drink as friends.
Grumio. [with BIONDELLO:] O excellent motion! Fellows, let's be gone.
Hortensio. The motion's good indeed, and be it so.
Petruchio, I shall be your ben venuto. Exeunt835

Enter KATHERINA and BIANCA

Bianca. Good sister, wrong me not, nor wrong yourself,
To make a bondmaid and a slave of me-
That I disdain; but for these other gawds,
Unbind my hands, I'll pull them off myself,840
Yea, all my raiment, to my petticoat;
Or what you will command me will I do,
So well I know my duty to my elders.
Katherina. Of all thy suitors here I charge thee tell
Whom thou lov'st best. See thou dissemble not.845
Bianca. Believe me, sister, of all the men alive
I never yet beheld that special face
Which I could fancy more than any other.
Katherina. Minion, thou liest. Is't not Hortensio?
Bianca. If you affect him, sister, here I swear850
I'll plead for you myself but you shall have him.
Katherina. O then, belike, you fancy riches more:
You will have Gremio to keep you fair.
Bianca. Is it for him you do envy me so?
Nay, then you jest; and now I well perceive855
You have but jested with me all this while.
I prithee, sister Kate, untie my hands.
Katherina. [Strikes her] If that be jest, then an the rest was so.
Enter BAPTISTA

Baptista Minola. Why, how now, dame! Whence grows this insolence?860
Bianca, stand aside- poor girl! she weeps.
[He unbinds her]
Go ply thy needle; meddle not with her.
For shame, thou hilding of a devilish spirit,
Why dost thou wrong her that did ne'er wrong thee?865
When did she cross thee with a bitter word?
Katherina. Her silence flouts me, and I'll be reveng'd.
[Flies after BIANCA]

Baptista Minola. What, in my sight? Bianca, get thee in.
[Exit BIANCA]

Katherina. What, will you not suffer me? Nay, now I see
She is your treasure, she must have a husband;
I must dance bare-foot on her wedding-day,
And for your love to her lead apes in hell.
Talk not to me; I will go sit and weep,875
Till I can find occasion of revenge. Exit KATHERINA
Baptista Minola. Was ever gentleman thus griev'd as I?
But who comes here?
Enter GREMIO, with LUCENTIO in the habit of a mean man; PETRUCHIO, with HORTENSIO as a musician; and TRANIO, as LUCENTIO, with his boy, BIONDELLO, bearing a lute and books

Gremio. Good morrow, neighbour Baptista.880
Baptista Minola. Good morrow, neighbour Gremio.
God save you, gentlemen!
Petruchio. And you, good sir! Pray, have you not a daughter
Call'd Katherina, fair and virtuous?
Baptista Minola. I have a daughter, sir, call'd Katherina.885
Gremio. You are too blunt; go to it orderly.
Petruchio. You wrong me, Signior Gremio; give me leave.
I am a gentleman of Verona, sir,
That, hearing of her beauty and her wit,
Her affability and bashful modesty,890
Her wondrous qualities and mild behaviour,
Am bold to show myself a forward guest
Within your house, to make mine eye the witness
Of that report which I so oft have heard.
And, for an entrance to my entertainment,895
I do present you with a man of mine,
[Presenting HORTENSIO]
Cunning in music and the mathematics,
To instruct her fully in those sciences,
Whereof I know she is not ignorant.900
Accept of him, or else you do me wrong-
His name is Licio, born in Mantua.
Baptista Minola. Y'are welcome, sir, and he for your good sake;
But for my daughter Katherine, this I know,
She is not for your turn, the more my grief.905
Petruchio. I see you do not mean to part with her;
Or else you like not of my company.
Baptista Minola. Mistake me not; I speak but as I find.
Whence are you, sir? What may I call your name?
Petruchio. Petruchio is my name, Antonio's son,910
A man well known throughout all Italy.
Baptista Minola. I know him well; you are welcome for his sake.
Gremio. Saving your tale, Petruchio, I pray,
Let us that are poor petitioners speak too.
Bacare! you are marvellous forward.915
Petruchio. O, pardon me, Signior Gremio! I would fain be doing.
Gremio. I doubt it not, sir; but you will curse your wooing.
Neighbour, this is a gift very grateful, I am sure of it. To
express the like kindness, myself, that have been more kindly
beholding to you than any, freely give unto you this young920
scholar [Presenting LUCENTIO] that hath been long studying at
Rheims; as cunning in Greek, Latin, and other languages, as the
other in music and mathematics. His name is Cambio. Pray accept
his service.
Baptista Minola. A thousand thanks, Signior Gremio. Welcome, good Cambio.925
[To TRANIO] But, gentle sir, methinks you walk like a stranger.
May I be so bold to know the cause of your coming?
Tranio. Pardon me, sir, the boldness is mine own
That, being a stranger in this city here,
Do make myself a suitor to your daughter,930
Unto Bianca, fair and virtuous.
Nor is your firm resolve unknown to me
In the preferment of the eldest sister.
This liberty is all that I request-
That, upon knowledge of my parentage,935
I may have welcome 'mongst the rest that woo,
And free access and favour as the rest.
And toward the education of your daughters
I here bestow a simple instrument,
And this small packet of Greek and Latin books.940
If you accept them, then their worth is great.
Baptista Minola. Lucentio is your name? Of whence, I pray?
Tranio. Of Pisa, sir; son to Vincentio.
Baptista Minola. A mighty man of Pisa. By report
I know him well. You are very welcome, sir.945
Take you the lute, and you the set of books;
You shall go see your pupils presently.
Holla, within!
[Enter a SERVANT]
Sirrah, lead these gentlemen950
To my daughters; and tell them both
These are their tutors. Bid them use them well.
[Exit SERVANT leading HORTENSIO carrying the lute and LUCENTIO with the books]
We will go walk a little in the orchard,
And then to dinner. You are passing welcome,955
And so I pray you all to think yourselves.
Petruchio. Signior Baptista, my business asketh haste,
And every day I cannot come to woo.
You knew my father well, and in him me,
Left solely heir to all his lands and goods,960
Which I have bettered rather than decreas'd.
Then tell me, if I get your daughter's love,
What dowry shall I have with her to wife?
Baptista Minola. After my death, the one half of my lands
And, in possession, twenty thousand crowns.965
Petruchio. And for that dowry, I'll assure her of
Her widowhood, be it that she survive me,
In all my lands and leases whatsoever.
Let specialities be therefore drawn between us,
That covenants may be kept on either hand.970
Baptista Minola. Ay, when the special thing is well obtain'd,
That is, her love; for that is all in all.
Petruchio. Why, that is nothing; for I tell you, father,
I am as peremptory as she proud-minded;
And where two raging fires meet together,975
They do consume the thing that feeds their fury.
Though little fire grows great with little wind,
Yet extreme gusts will blow out fire and all.
So I to her, and so she yields to me;
For I am rough, and woo not like a babe.980
Baptista Minola. Well mayst thou woo, and happy be thy speed
But be thou arm'd for some unhappy words.
Petruchio. Ay, to the proof, as mountains are for winds,
That shake not though they blow perpetually.
Re-enter HORTENSIO, with his head broke

Baptista Minola. How now, my friend! Why dost thou look so pale?
Hortensio. For fear, I promise you, if I look pale.
Baptista Minola. What, will my daughter prove a good musician?
Hortensio. I think she'll sooner prove a soldier:
Iron may hold with her, but never lutes.990
Baptista Minola. Why, then thou canst not break her to the lute?
Hortensio. Why, no; for she hath broke the lute to me.
I did but tell her she mistook her frets,
And bow'd her hand to teach her fingering,
When, with a most impatient devilish spirit,995
'Frets, call you these?' quoth she 'I'll fume with them.'
And with that word she struck me on the head,
And through the instrument my pate made way;
And there I stood ama~ed for ~ while,
As on a pillory, looking through the lute,1000
While she did call me rascal fiddler
And twangling Jack, with twenty such vile terms,
As she had studied to misuse me so.
Petruchio. Now, by the world, it is a lusty wench;
I love her ten times more than e'er I did.1005
O, how I long to have some chat with her!
Baptista Minola. Well, go with me, and be not so discomfited;
Proceed in practice with my younger daughter;
She's apt to learn, and thankful for good turns.
Signior Petruchio, will you go with us,1010
Or shall I send my daughter Kate to you?
Petruchio. I pray you do. Exeunt all but PETRUC~~O
I'll attend her here,
And woo her with some spirit when she comes.
Say that she rail; why, then I'll tell her plain1015
She sings as sweetly as a nightingale.
Say that she frown; I'll say she looks as clear
As morning roses newly wash'd with dew.
Say she be mute, and will not speak a word;
Then I'll commend her volubility,1020
And say she uttereth piercing eloquence.
If she do bid me pack, I'll give her thanks,
As though she bid me stay by her a week;
If she deny to wed, I'll crave the day
When I shall ask the banns, and when be married.1025
But here she comes; and now, Petruchio, speak.
[Enter KATHERINA]
Good morrow, Kate- for that's your name, I hear.
Katherina. Well have you heard, but something hard of hearing:
They call me Katherine that do talk of me.1030
Petruchio. You lie, in faith, for you are call'd plain Kate,
And bonny Kate, and sometimes Kate the curst;
But, Kate, the prettiest Kate in Christendom,
Kate of Kate Hall, my super-dainty Kate,
For dainties are all Kates, and therefore, Kate,1035
Take this of me, Kate of my consolation-
Hearing thy mildness prais'd in every town,
Thy virtues spoke of, and thy beauty sounded,
Yet not so deeply as to thee belongs,
Myself am mov'd to woo thee for my wife.1040
Katherina. Mov'd! in good time! Let him that mov'd you hither
Remove you hence. I knew you at the first
You were a moveable.
Petruchio. Why, what's a moveable?
Katherina. A join'd-stool.1045
Petruchio. Thou hast hit it. Come, sit on me.
Katherina. Asses are made to bear, and so are you.
Petruchio. Women are made to bear, and so are you.
Katherina. No such jade as you, if me you mean.
Petruchio. Alas, good Kate, I will not burden thee!1050
For, knowing thee to be but young and light-
Katherina. Too light for such a swain as you to catch;
And yet as heavy as my weight should be.
Petruchio. Should be! should- bu~z!
Katherina. Well ta'en, an~ like a buzzard.~055
Petruchio. O, slow-wing'd turtle, shall a buzzard take thee?
Katherina. Ay, for a turtle, as he takes a buzzard.
Petruchio. Come, come, you wasp; i' faith, you are too angry.
Katherina. If I be waspish, best beware my sting.
Petruchio. My remedy is then to pluck it out.1060
Katherina. Ay, if the fool could find it where it lies.
Petruchio. Who knows not where a wasp does wear his sting?
In his tail.
Katherina. In his tongue.
Petruchio. Whose tongue?1065
Katherina. Yours, if you talk of tales; and so farewell.
Petruchio. What, with my tongue in your tail? Nay, come again,
Good Kate; I am a gentleman.
Katherina. That I'll try. [She strikes him]
Petruchio. I swear I'll cuff you, if you strike again.1070
Katherina. So may you lose your arms.
If you strike me, you are no gentleman;
And if no gentleman, why then no arms.
Petruchio. A herald, Kate? O, put me in thy books!
Katherina. What is your crest- a coxcomb?1075
Petruchio. A combless cock, so Kate will be my hen.
Katherina. No cock of mine: you crow too like a craven.
Petruchio. Nay, come, Kate, come; you must not look so sour.
Katherina. It is my fashion, when I see a crab.
Petruchio. Why, here's no crab; and therefore look not sour.1080
Katherina. There is, there is.
Petruchio. Then show it me.
Katherina. Had I a glass I would.
Petruchio. What, you mean my face?
Katherina. Well aim'd of such a young one.1085
Petruchio. Now, by Saint George, I am too young for you.
Katherina. Yet you are wither'd.
Petruchio. 'Tis with cares.
Katherina. I care not.
Petruchio. Nay, hear you, Kate- in sooth, you scape not so.10~0
Katherina. I chafe you, if I tarry; let me go.
Petruchio. No, not a whit; I find you pa~sing gentle.
'Twas told me you were rough, and coy, and sullen,
And now I find report a very liar;
For thou art pleasant, gamesome, passing courteous,1095
But slow in speech, yet sweet as springtime flowers.
Thou canst not frown, thou canst not look askance,
Nor bite the lip, as angry wenches will,
Nor hast thou pleasure to be cross in talk;
But thou with mildness entertain'st thy wooers;1100
With gentle conference, soft and affable.
Why does the world report that Kate doth limp?
O sland'rous world! Kate like the hazel-twig
Is straight and slender, and as brown in hue
As hazel-nuts, and sweeter than the kernels.1105
O, let me see thee walk. Thou dost not halt.
Katherina. Go, fool, and whom thou keep'st command.
Petruchio. Did ever Dian so become a grove
As Kate this chamber with her princely gait?
O, be thou Dian, and let her be Kate;1110
And then let Kate be chaste, and Dian sportful!
Katherina. Where did you study all this goodly speech?
Petruchio. It is extempore, from my mother wit.
Katherina. A witty mother! witless else her son.
Petruchio. Am I not wise?1115
Katherina. Yes, keep you warm.
Petruchio. ~arry, so I mean, sweet Katherine, in thy bed.
And therefore, setting all this chat aside,
Thus in plain terms: your father hath consented
That you shall be my wife your dowry greed on;1120
And will you, nill you, I will marry you.
Now, Kate, I am a husband for your turn;
For, by this light, whereby I see thy beauty,
Thy beauty that doth make me like thee well,
Thou must be married to no man but me;1125
For I am he am born to tame you, Kate,
And bring you from a wild Kate to a Kate
Conformable as other household Kates.
[Re-enter BAPTISTA, GREMIO, and TRANIO]
Here comes your father. Never make denial;11~0
I must and will have Katherine to my wife.
Baptista Minola. Now, Signior Petruchio, how speed you with my daughter?
Petruchio. How but well, sir? how but well?
It were impossible I should speed amiss.
Baptista Minola. Why, how now, daughter Katherine, in your dumps?1135
Katherina. Call you me daughter? Now I promise you
You have show'd a tender fatherly regard
To wish me wed to one half lunatic,
A mad-cap ruffian and a swearing Jack,
That thinks with oaths to face the matter out.1140
Petruchio. Father, 'tis thus: yourself and all the world
That talk'd of her have talk'd amiss of her.
If she be curst, it is for policy,
For,she's not froward, but modest as the dove;
She is not hot, but temperate as the morn;1145
For patience she will prove a second Grissel,
And ~oman Lucrece for her chastity.
And, to conclude, we have 'greed so well together
That upon Sunday is the wedding-day.
Katherina. I'll see thee hang'd on Sunday first.115~
Gremio. Hark, Petruchio; she says she'll see thee hang'd first.
Tranio. Is this your speeding? Nay, then good-night our part!
Petruchio. Be patient, gentlemen. I choose her for myself;
If she and I be pleas'd, what's that to you?
'Tis bargain'd 'twixt us twain, being alone,1155
That she shall still be curst in company.
I tell you 'tis incredible to believe.
How much she loves me- O, the kindest Kate!
She hung about my neck, and kiss on kiss
She vied so fast, protesting oath on oath,1160
That in a twink she won me to her love.
O, you are novices! 'Tis a world to see,
How tame, when men and women are alone,
A meacock wretch can make the curstest shrew.
Give me thy hand, Kate; I will unto Venice,1165
To buy apparel 'gainst the wedding-day.
Provide the feast, father, and bid the guests;
I will be sure my Katherine shall be fine.
Baptista ~inola. I know not what to say; but give me your hands.
God send you joy, Petruchio! 'Tis a match.1170
Gremio. [with TRANIO:] Amen, say we; we will be witnesses.
Petruchio. Father, and wife, and gentlemen, adieu.
I will to Venice; Sunday comes apace;
We will have rings and things, and fine array;
And kiss me, Kate; we will be married a Sunday.1175
Exeunt PETRUCHIO and KATHERINA severally

Gremio. Was ever match clapp'd up so suddenly?
Baptista Minola. Faith, gentlemen, now I play a merchant's part,
And venture madly on a desperate mart.
Tranio. 'Twas a commodity lay fretting by you;1180
'Twill bring you gain, or perish on the seas.
Baptista Minola. The gain I seek is quiet in the match.
Gremio. No doubt but he hath got a quiet catch.
But now, Baptista, to your younger daughter:
Now is the day we long have looked for;1185
I am your neighbour, and was suitor first.
Tranio. And I am one that love Bianca more
Than words can witness or your thoughts can guess.
Gremio. Youngling, thou canst not love so dear as I.
Tranio. Greybeard, thy love doth freeze.1190
Gremio. But thine doth fry.
Skipper, stand back; 'tis age that nourisheth.
Tranio. But youth in ladies' eyes that flourisheth.
Baptista Minola. Content you, gentlemen; I will compound this strife.
'Tis deeds must win the prize, and he of both1195
That can assure my daughter greatest dower
Shall have my Bianca's love.
Say, Signior Gremio, what can you assure her?
Gremio. First, as you know, my house within the city
Is richly furnished with plate and gold,1200
Basins and ewers to lave her dainty hands;
My hangings all of Tyrian tapestry;
In ivory coffers I have stuff'd my crowns;
In cypress chests my arras counterpoints,
Costly apparel, tents, and canopies,1205
Fine linen, Turkey cushions boss'd with pearl,
Valance of Venice gold in needle-work;
Pewter and brass, and all things that belongs
To house or housekeeping. Then at my farm
I have a hundred milch-kine to the pail,1210
Six score fat oxen standing in my stalls,
And all things answerable to this portion.
Myself am struck in years, I must confess;
And if I die to-morrow this is hers,
If whilst I live she will be only mine.1215
Tranio. That 'only' came well in. Sir, list to me:
I am my father's heir and only son;
If I may have your daughter to my wife,
I'll leave her houses three or four as good
Within rich Pisa's walls as any one1220
Old Signior Gremio has in Padua;
Besides two thousand ducats by the year
Of fruitful land, all which shall be her jointure.
What, have I pinch'd you, Signior Gremio?
Gremio. Two thousand ducats by the year of land!1225
[Aside] My land amounts not to so much in all.-
That she shall have, besides an argosy
That now is lying in Marseilles road.
What, have I chok'd you with an argosy?
Tranio. Gremio, 'tis known my father hath no less12~0
Than three great argosies, besides two galliasses,
And twelve tight galleys. These I will assure her,
And twice as much whate'er thou off'rest next.
Gremio. Nay, I have off'red all; I have no more;
And she can have no more than all I have;1235
If you like me, she shall have me and mine.
Tranio. Why, then the maid is mine from all the world
By your firm promise; Gremio is out-vied.
Baptista Minola. I must confess your offer is the best;
And let your father make her the assurance,1240
She is your own. Else, you must pardon me;
If you should die before him, where's her dower?
Tranio. That's but a cavil; he is old, I young.
Gremio. And may not young men die as well as old?
Baptista Minola. Well, gentlemen,1245
I am thus resolv'd: on Sunday next you know
My daughter Katherine is to be married;
Now, on the Sunday following shall Bianca
Be bride to you, if you make this assurance;
If not, to Signior Gremio.1250
And so I take my leave, and thank you both.
Gremio. Adieu, good neighbour. Exit BAPTISTA
Now, I fear thee not.
Sirrah young gamester, your father were a fool
To give thee all, and in his waning age1255
Set foot under thy table. Tut, a toy!
An old Italian fox is not so kind, my boy. Exit
Tranio. A vengeance on your crafty withered hide!
Yet I have fac'd it with a card of ten.
'Tis in my head to do my master good:1260
I see no reason but suppos'd Lucentio
Must get a father, call'd suppos'd Vincentio;
And that's a wonder- fathers commonly
Do get their children; but in this case of wooing
A child shall get a sire, if I fail not of my cunning.1265

Enter LUCENTIO as CAMBIO, HORTENSIO as LICIO, and BIANCA

Lucentio. Fiddler, forbear; you grow too forward, sir.
Have you so soon forgot the entertainment
Her sister Katherine welcome'd you withal?1270
Hortensio. But, wrangling pedant, this is
The patroness of heavenly harmony.
Then give me leave to have prerogative;
And when in music we have spent an hour,
Your lecture shall have leisure for as much.1275
Lucentio. Preposterous ass, that never read so far
To know the cause why music was ordain'd!
Was it not to refresh the mind of man
After his studies or his usual pain?
Then give me leave to read philosophy,1280
And while I pause serve in your harmony.
Hortensio. Sirrah, I will not bear these braves of thine.
Bianca. Why, gentlemen, you do me double wrong
To strive for that which resteth in my choice.
I am no breeching scholar in the schools,1285
I'll not be tied to hours nor 'pointed times,
But learn my lessons as I please myself.
And to cut off all strife: here sit we down;
Take you your instrument, play you the whiles!
His lecture will be done ere you have tun'd.1290
Hortensio. You'll leave his lecture when I am in tune?
Lucentio. That will be never- tune your instrument.
Bianca. Where left we last?
Lucentio. Here, madam:
'Hic ibat Simois, hic est Sigeia tellus,1295
Hic steterat Priami regia celsa senis.'
Bianca. Construe them.
Lucentio. 'Hic ibat' as I told you before- 'Simois' I am Lucentio-
'hic est' son unto Vincentio of Pisa- 'Sigeia tellus' disguised
thus to get your love- 'Hic steterat' and that Lucentio that1300
comes a-wooing- 'Priami' is my man Tranio- 'regia' bearing my
port- 'celsa senis' that we might beguile the old pantaloon.
Hortensio. Madam, my instrument's in tune.
Bianca. Let's hear. O fie! the treble jars.
Lucentio. Spit in the hole, man, and tune again.1305
Bianca. Now let me see if I can construe it: 'Hic ibat Simois' I
know you not- 'hic est Sigeia tellus' I trust you not- 'Hic
steterat Priami' take heed he hear us not- 'regia' presume not-
'celsa senis' despair not.
Hortensio. Madam, 'tis now in tune.1310
Lucentio. All but the bass.
Hortensio. The bass is right; 'tis the base knave that jars.
[Aside] How fiery and forward our pedant is!
Now, for my life, the knave doth court my love.
Pedascule, I'll watch you better yet.1315
Bianca. In time I may believe, yet I mistrust.
Lucentio. Mistrust it not- for sure, AEacides
Was Ajax, call'd so from his grandfather.
Bianca. I must believe my master; else, I promise you,
I should be arguing still upon that doubt;1320
But let it rest. Now, Licio, to you.
Good master, take it not unkindly, pray,
That I have been thus pleasant with you both.
Hortensio. [To LUCENTIO] You may go walk and give me leave
awhile;1325
My lessons make no music in three Parts.
Lucentio. Are you so formal, sir? Well, I must wait,
[Aside] And watch withal; for, but I be deceiv'd,
Our fine musician groweth amorous.
Hortensio. Madam, before you touch the instrument1330
To learn the order of my fingering,
I must begin with rudiments of art,
To teach you gamut in a briefer sort,
More pleasant, pithy, and effectual,
Than hath been taught by any of my trade;1335
And there it is in writing fairly drawn.
Bianca. Why, I am past my gamut long ago.
Hortensio. Yet read the gamut of Hortensio.
Bianca. [Reads]
'"Gamut" I am, the ground of all accord-1340
"A re" to plead Hortensio's passion-
"B mi" Bianca, take him for thy lord-
"C fa ut" that loves with all affection-
"D sol re" one clef, two notes have I-
"E la mi" show pity or I die.'1345
Call you this gamut? Tut, I like it not!
Old fashions please me best; I am not so nice
To change true rules for odd inventions.
Enter a SERVANT

Servant. Mistress, your father prays you leave your books1350
And help to dress your sister's chamber up.
You know to-morrow is the wedding-day.
Bianca. Farewell, sweet masters, both; I must be gone.
Exeunt BIANCA and SERVANT

Lucentio. Faith, mistress, then I have no cause to stay.1355
Exit

Hortensio. But I have cause to pry into this pedant;
Methinks he looks as though he were in love.
Yet if thy thoughts, Bianca, be so humble
To cast thy wand'ring eyes on every stale-1360
Seize thee that list. If once I find thee ranging,
Hortensio will be quit with thee by changing. Exit

Enter BAPTISTA, GREMIO, TRANIO as LUCENTIO, KATHERINA, BIANCA, LUCENTIO as CAMBIO, and ATTENDANTS

Baptista Minola. [To TRANIO] Signior Lucentio, this is the 'pointed day
That Katherine and Petruchio should be married,1365
And yet we hear not of our son-in-law.
What will be said? What mockery will it be
To want the bridegroom when the priest attends
To speak the ceremonial rites of marriage!
What says Lucentio to this shame of ours?1370
Katherina. No shame but mine; I must, forsooth, be forc'd
To give my hand, oppos'd against my heart,
Unto a mad-brain rudesby, full of spleen,
Who woo'd in haste and means to wed at leisure.
I told you, I, he was a frantic fool,1375
Hiding his bitter jests in blunt behaviour;
And, to be noted for a merry man,
He'll woo a thousand, 'point the day of marriage,
Make friends invited, and proclaim the banns;
Yet never means to wed where he hath woo'd.1380
Now must the world point at poor Katherine,
And say 'Lo, there is mad Petruchio's wife,
If it would please him come and marry her!'
Tranio. Patience, good Katherine, and Baptista too.
Upon my life, Petruchio means but well,1385
Whatever fortune stays him from his word.
Though he be blunt, I know him passing wise;
Though he be merry, yet withal he's honest.
Katherina. Would Katherine had never seen him though!
Exit, weeping, followed by BIANCA and others

Baptista Minola. Go, girl, I cannot blame thee now to weep,
For such an injury would vex a very saint;
Much more a shrew of thy impatient humour.
[Enter BIONDELLO]
Master, master! News, and such old news as you never heard of!1395
Baptista Minola. Is it new and old too? How may that be?
Biondello. Why, is it not news to hear of Petruchio's coming?
Baptista Minola. Is he come?
Biondello. Why, no, sir.
Baptista Minola. What then?1400
Biondello. He is coming.
Baptista Minola. When will he be here?
Biondello. When he stands where I am and sees you there.
Tranio. But, say, what to thine old news?
Biondello. Why, Petruchio is coming- in a new hat and an old1405
jerkin; a pair of old breeches thrice turn'd; a pair of boots
that have been candle-cases, one buckled, another lac'd; an old
rusty sword ta'en out of the town armoury, with a broken hilt,
and chapeless; with two broken points; his horse hipp'd, with an
old motley saddle and stirrups of no kindred; besides, possess'd1410
with the glanders and like to mose in the chine, troubled with
the lampass, infected with the fashions, full of windgalls, sped
with spavins, rayed with the yellows, past cure of the fives,
stark spoil'd with the staggers, begnawn with the bots, sway'd in
the back and shoulder-shotten, near-legg'd before, and with a1415
half-cheek'd bit, and a head-stall of sheep's leather which,
being restrained to keep him from stumbling, hath been often
burst, and now repaired with knots; one girth six times piec'd,
and a woman's crupper of velure, which hath two letters for her
name fairly set down in studs, and here and there piec'd with1420
pack-thread.
Baptista Minola. Who comes with him?
Biondello. O, sir, his lackey, for all the world caparison'd like
the horse- with a linen stock on one leg and a kersey boot-hose
on the other, gart'red with a red and blue list; an old hat, and1425
the humour of forty fancies prick'd in't for a feather; a
monster, a very monster in apparel, and not like a Christian
footboy or a gentleman's lackey.
Tranio. 'Tis some odd humour pricks him to this fashion;
Yet oftentimes lie goes but mean-apparell'd.1430
Baptista Minola. I am glad he's come, howsoe'er he comes.
Biondello. Why, sir, he comes not.
Baptista Minola. Didst thou not say he comes?
Biondello. Who? that Petruchio came?
Baptista Minola. Ay, that Petruchio came.1435
Biondello. No, sir; I say his horse comes with him on his back.
Baptista Minola. Why, that's all one.
Biondello. Nay, by Saint ~amy,
I hold you a penny,
A horse and a man1440
Is more than one,
And yet not many.
Enter PETRUCHIO and GRUMIO

Petruchio. Come, where be these gallants? Who's at home?
Baptista Minola. You are welcome, sir.1445
Petruchio. And yet I come not well.
Baptista Minola. And yet you halt not.
Tranio. Not so well apparell'd
As I wish you were.
Petruchio. Were it better, I should rush in thus.1450
But where is Kate? Where is my lovely bride?
How does my father? Gentles, methinks you frown;
And wherefore gaze this goodly company
As if they saw some wondrous monument,
Some comet or unusual prodigy?1455
Baptista Minola. Why, sir, you know this is your wedding-day.
First were we sad, fearing you would not come;
Now sadder, that you come so unprovided.
Fie, doff this habit, shame to your estate,
An eye-sore to our solemn festival!1460
Tranio. And tell us what occasion of import
Hath all so long detain'd you from your wife,
And sent you hither so unlike yourself?
Petruchio. Tedious it were to tell, and harsh to hear;
Sufficeth I am come to keep my word,1465
Though in some part enforced to digress,
Which at more leisure I will so excuse
As you shall well be satisfied withal.
But where is Kate? I stay too long from her;
The morning wears, 'tis time we were at church.1470
Tranio. See not your bride in these unreverent robes;
Go to my chamber, put on clothes of mine.
Petruchio. Not I, believe me; thus I'll visit her.
Baptista Minola. But thus, I trust, you will not marry her.
Petruchio. Good sooth, even thus; therefore ha' done with words;1475
To me she's married, not unto my clothes.
Could I repair what she will wear in me
As I can change these poor accoutrements,
'Twere well for Kate and better for myself.
But what a fool am I to chat with you,1480
When I should bid good-morrow to my bride
And seal the title with a lovely kiss!
Exeunt PETRUCHIO and PETRUCHIO

Tranio. He hath some meaning in his mad attire.
We will persuade him, be it possible,1485
To put on better ere he go to church.
Baptista Minola. I'll after him and see the event of this.
Exeunt BAPTISTA, GREMIO, BIONDELLO, and ATTENDENTS

Tranio. But to her love concerneth us to add
Her father's liking; which to bring to pass,14~0
As I before imparted to your worship,
I am to get a man- whate'er he be
It skills not much; we'll fit him to our turn-
And he shall be Vincentio of Pisa,
And make assurance here in Padua1495
Of greater sums than I have promised.
So shall you quietly enjoy your hope
And marry sweet Bianca with consent.
Lucentio. Were it not that my fellow schoolmaster
Doth watch Bianca's steps so narrowly,1500
'Twere good, methinks, to steal our marriage;
Which once perform'd, let all the world say no,
I'll keep mine own despite of all the world.
Tranio. That by degrees we mean to look into
And watch our vantage in this business;1505
We'll over-reach the greybeard, Gremio,
The narrow-prying father, Minola,
The quaint musician, amorous Licio-
All for my master's sake, Lucentio.
[Re-enter GREMIO]1510
Signior Gremio, came you from the church?
Gremio. As willingly as e'er I came from school.
Tranio. And is the bride and bridegroom coming home?
Gremio. A bridegroom, say you? 'Tis a groom indeed,
A grumbling groom, and that the girl shall find.1515
Tranio. Curster than she? Why, 'tis impossible.
Gremio. Why, he's a devil, a devil, a very fiend.
Tranio. Why, she's a devil, a devil, the devil's dam.
Gremio. Tut, she's a lamb, a dove, a fool, to him!
I'll tell you, Sir Lucentio: when the priest1520
Should ask if Katherine should be his wife,
'Ay, by gogs-wouns' quoth he, and swore so loud
That, all amaz'd, the priest let fall the book;
And as he stoop'd again to take it up,
This mad-brain'd bridegroom took him such a cuff1525
That down fell priest and book, and book and priest.
'Now take them up,' quoth he 'if any list.'
Tranio. What said the wench, when he rose again?
Gremio. Trembled and shook, for why he stamp'd and swore
As if the vicar meant to cozen him.1530
But after many ceremonies done
He calls for wine: 'A health!' quoth he, as if
He had been abroad, carousing to his mates
After a storm; quaff'd off the muscadel,
And threw the sops all in the sexton's face,1535
Having no other reason
But that his beard grew thin and hungerly
And seem'd to ask him sops as he was drinking.
This done, he took the bride about the neck,
And kiss'd her lips with such a clamorous smack1540
That at the parting all the church did echo.
And I, seeing this, came thence for very shame;
And after me, I know, the rout is coming.
Such a mad marriage never was before.
Hark, hark! I hear the minstrels play. [Music plays]1545
Enter PETRUCHIO, KATHERINA, BIANCA, BAPTISTA, HORTENSIO, GRUMIO, and train
Petruchio. Gentlemen and friends, I thank you for your pains.
I know you think to dine with me to-day,
And have prepar'd great store of wedding cheer
But so it is- my haste doth call me hence,1550
And therefore here I mean to take my leave.
Baptista Minola. Is't possible you will away to-night?
Petruchio. I must away to-day before night come.
Make it no wonder; if you knew my business,
You would entreat me rather go than stay.1555
And, honest company, I thank you all
That have beheld me give away myself
To this most patient, sweet, and virtuous wife.
Dine with my father, drink a health to me.
For I must hence; and farewell to you all.1560
Tranio. Let us entreat you stay till after dinner.
Petruchio. It may not be.
Gremio. Let me entreat you.
Petruchio. It cannot be.
Katherina. Let me entreat you.1565
Petruchio. I am content.
Katherina. Are you content to stay?
Petruchio. I am content you shall entreat me stay;
But yet not stay, entreat me how you can.
Katherina. Now, if you love me, stay.1570
Petruchio. Grumio, my horse.
Grumio. Ay, sir, they be ready; the oats have eaten the horses.
Katherina. Nay, then,
Do what thou canst, I will not go to-day;
No, nor to-morrow, not till I please myself.1575
The door is open, sir; there lies your way;
You may be jogging whiles your boots are green;
For me, I'll not be gone till I please myself.
'Tis like you'll prove a jolly surly groom
That take it on you at the first so roundly.1580
Petruchio. O Kate, content thee; prithee be not angry.
Katherina. I will be angry; what hast thou to do?
Father, be quiet; he shall stay my leisure.
Gremio. Ay, marry, sir, now it begins to work.
Katherina. Gentlemen, forward to the bridal dinner.1585
I see a woman may be made a fool
If she had not a spirit to resist.
Petruchio. They shall go forward, Kate, at thy command.
Obey the bride, you that attend on her;
Go to the feast, revel and domineer,1590
Carouse full measure to her maidenhead;
Be mad and merry, or go hang yourselves.
But for my bonny Kate, she must with me.
Nay, look not big, nor stamp, nor stare, nor fret;
I will be master of what is mine own-1595
She is my goods, my chattels, she is my house,
My household stuff, my field, my barn,
My horse, my ox, my ass, my any thing,
And here she stands; touch her whoever dare;
I'll bring mine action on the proudest he1600
That stops my way in Padua. Grumio,
Draw forth thy weapon; we are beset with thieves;
Rescue thy mistress, if thou be a man.
Fear not, sweet wench; they shall not touch thee, Kate;
I'll buckler thee against a million.1605
Exeunt PETRUCHIO, KATHERINA, and GRUMIO

Baptista Minola. Nay, let them go, a couple of quiet ones.
Gremio. Went they not quickly, I should die with laughing.
Tranio. Of all mad matches, never was the like.
Lucentio. Mistress, what's your opinion of your sister?1610
Bianca. That, being mad herself, she's madly mated.
Gremio. I warrant him, Petruchio is Kated.
Baptista Minola. Neighbours and friends, though bride and bridegroom wants
For to supply the places at the table,
You know there wants no junkets at the feast.1615
Lucentio, you shall supply the bridegroom's place;
And let Bianca take her sister's room.
Tranio. Shall sweet Bianca practise how to bride it?
Baptista Minola. She shall, Lucentio. Come, gentlemen, let's go.

Enter GRUMIO

Grumio. Fie, fie on all tired jades, on all mad masters, and all
foul ways! Was ever man so beaten? Was ever man so ray'd? Was
ever man so weary? I am sent before to make a fire, and they are
coming after to warm them. Now were not I a little pot and soon
hot, my very lips might freeze to my teeth, my tongue to the roof1625
of my mouth, my heart in my belly, ere I should come by a fire to
thaw me. But I with blowing the fire shall warm myself; for,
considering the weather, a taller man than I will take cold.
Holla, ho! Curtis!
Enter CURTIS

Curtis. Who is that calls so coldly?
Grumio. A piece of ice. If thou doubt it, thou mayst slide from my
shoulder to my heel with no greater a run but my head and my
neck. A fire, good Curtis.
Curtis. Is my master and his wife coming, Grumio?1635
Grumio. O, ay, Curtis, ay; and therefore fire, fire; cast on no
water.
Curtis. Is she so hot a shrew as she's reported?
Grumio. She was, good Curtis, before this frost; but thou know'st
winter tames man, woman, and beast; for it hath tam'd my old1640
master, and my new mistress, and myself, fellow Curtis.
Curtis. Away, you three-inch fool! I am no beast.
Grumio. Am I but three inches? Why, thy horn is a foot, and so long
am I at the least. But wilt thou make a fire, or shall I complain
on thee to our mistress, whose hand- she being now at hand- thou1645
shalt soon feel, to thy cold comfort, for being slow in thy hot
office?
Curtis. I prithee, good Grumio, tell me how goes the world?
Grumio. A cold world, Curtis, in every office but thine; and
therefore fire. Do thy duty, and have thy duty, for my master and1650
mistress are almost frozen to death.
Curtis. There's fire ready; and therefore, good Grumio, the news?
Grumio. Why, 'Jack boy! ho, boy!' and as much news as thou wilt.
Curtis. Come, you are so full of cony-catching!
Grumio. Why, therefore, fire; for I have caught extreme cold.1655
Where's the cook? Is supper ready, the house trimm'd, rushes
strew'd, cobwebs swept, the serving-men in their new fustian,
their white stockings, and every officer his wedding-garment on?
Be the jacks fair within, the jills fair without, the carpets
laid, and everything in order?1660
Curtis. All ready; and therefore, I pray thee, news.
Grumio. First know my horse is tired; my master and mistress fall'n
out.
Curtis. How?
Grumio. Out of their saddles into the dirt; and thereby hangs a1665
tale.
Curtis. Let's ha't, good Grumio.
Grumio. Lend thine ear.
Curtis. Here.
Grumio. There. [Striking him]1670
Curtis. This 'tis to feel a tale, not to hear a tale.
Grumio. And therefore 'tis call'd a sensible tale; and this cuff
was but to knock at your car and beseech list'ning. Now I begin:
Imprimis, we came down a foul hill, my master riding behind my
mistress-1675
Curtis. Both of one horse?
Grumio. What's that to thee?
Curtis. Why, a horse.
Grumio. Tell thou the tale. But hadst thou not cross'd me, thou
shouldst have heard how her horse fell and she under her horse;1680
thou shouldst have heard in how miry a place, how she was
bemoil'd, how he left her with the horse upon her, how he beat me
because her horse stumbled, how she waded through the dirt to
pluck him off me, how he swore, how she pray'd that never pray'd
before, how I cried, how the horses ran away, how her bridle was1685
burst, how I lost my crupper- with many things of worthy memory,
which now shall die in oblivion, and thou return unexperienc'd to
thy grave.
Curtis. By this reck'ning he is more shrew than she.
Grumio. Ay, and that thou and the proudest of you all shall find1690
when he comes home. But what talk I of this? Call forth
Nathaniel, Joseph, Nicholas, Philip, Walter, Sugarsop, and the
rest; let their heads be sleekly comb'd, their blue coats brush'd
and their garters of an indifferent knit; let them curtsy with
their left legs, and not presume to touch a hair of my mastcr's1695
horse-tail till they kiss their hands. Are they all ready?
Curtis. They are.
Grumio. Call them forth.
Curtis. Do you hear, ho? You must meet my master, to countenance my
mistress.1700
Grumio. Why, she hath a face of her own.
Curtis. Who knows not that?
Grumio. Thou, it seems, that calls for company to countenance her.
Curtis. I call them forth to credit her.
Grumio. Why, she comes to borrow nothing of them.1705
Enter four or five SERVINGMEN

Nathaniel. Welcome home, Grumio!
Philip. How now, Grumio!
Joseph. What, Grumio!
Nicholas. Fellow Grumio!1710
Nathaniel. How now, old lad!
Grumio. Welcome, you!- how now, you!- what, you!- fellow, you!- and
thus much for greeting. Now, my spruce companions, is all ready,
and all things neat?
Nathaniel. All things is ready. How near is our master?1715
Grumio. E'en at hand, alighted by this; and therefore be not-
Cock's passion, silence! I hear my master.
Enter PETRUCHIO and KATHERINA

Petruchio. Where be these knaves? What, no man at door
To hold my stirrup nor to take my horse!1720
Where is Nathaniel, Gregory, Philip?
Servants. Here, here, sir; here, sir.
Petruchio. Here, sir! here, sir! here, sir! here, sir!
You logger-headed and unpolish'd grooms!
What, no attendance? no regard? no duty?1725
Where is the foolish knave I sent before?
Grumio. Here, sir; as foolish as I was before.
Petruchio. YOU peasant swain! you whoreson malt-horse drudge!
Did I not bid thee meet me in the park
And bring along these rascal knaves with thee?1730
Grumio. Nathaniel's coat, sir, was not fully made,
And Gabriel's pumps were all unpink'd i' th' heel;
There was no link to colour Peter's hat,
And Walter's dagger was not come from sheathing;
There were none fine but Adam, Ralph, and Gregory;1735
The rest were ragged, old, and beggarly;
Yet, as they are, here are they come to meet you.
Petruchio. Go, rascals, go and fetch my supper in.
[Exeunt some of the SERVINGMEN]
[Sings] Where is the life that late I led?1740
Where are those-
Sit down, Kate, and welcome. Soud, soud, soud, soud!
[Re-enter SERVANTS with supper]
Why, when, I say? Nay, good sweet Kate, be merry.
Off with my boots, you rogues! you villains, when?1745
[Sings] It was the friar of orders grey,
As he forth walked on his way-
Out, you rogue! you pluck my foot awry;
Take that, and mend the plucking off the other.
[Strikes him]1750
Be merry, Kate. Some water, here, what, ho!
[Enter one with water]
Where's my spaniel Troilus? Sirrah, get you hence,
And bid my cousin Ferdinand come hither:
[Exit SERVINGMAN]1755
One, Kate, that you must kiss and be acquainted with.
Where are my slippers? Shall I have some water?
Come, Kate, and wash, and welcome heartily.
You whoreson villain! will you let it fall? [Strikes him]
Katherina. Patience, I pray you; 'twas a fault unwilling.1760
Petruchio. A whoreson, beetle-headed, flap-ear'd knave!
Come, Kate, sit down; I know you have a stomach.
Will you give thanks, sweet Kate, or else shall I?
What's this? Mutton?
First Servant. Ay.1765
Petruchio. Who brought it?
Peter. I.
Petruchio. 'Tis burnt; and so is all the meat.
What dogs are these? Where is the rascal cook?
How durst you villains bring it from the dresser1770
And serve it thus to me that love it not?
There, take it to you, trenchers, cups, and all;
[Throws the meat, etc., at them]
You heedless joltheads and unmanner'd slaves!
What, do you grumble? I'll be with you straight.1775
[Exeunt SERVANTS]

Katherina. I pray you, husband, be not so disquiet;
The meat was well, if you were so contented.
Petruchio. I tell thee, Kate, 'twas burnt and dried away,
And I expressly am forbid to touch it;1780
For it engenders choler, planteth anger;
And better 'twere that both of us did fast,
Since, of ourselves, ourselves are choleric,
Than feed it with such over-roasted flesh.
Be patient; to-morrow 't shall be mended.1785
And for this night we'll fast for company.
Come, I will bring thee to thy bridal chamber. Exeunt
Re-enter SERVANTS severally

Nathaniel. Peter, didst ever see the like?
Peter. He kills her in her own humour.1790
Re-enter CURTIS

Grumio. Where is he?
Curtis. In her chamber. Making a sermon of continency to her,
And rails, and swears, and rates, that she, poor soul,
Knows not which way to stand, to look, to speak.1795
And sits as one new risen from a dream.
Away, away! for he is coming hither. Exeunt
Re-enter PETRUCHIO

Petruchio. Thus have I politicly begun my reign,
And 'tis my hope to end successfully.1800
My falcon now is sharp and passing empty.
And till she stoop she must not be full-gorg'd,
For then she never looks upon her lure.
Another way I have to man my haggard,
To make her come, and know her keeper's call,1805
That is, to watch her, as we watch these kites
That bate and beat, and will not be obedient.
She eat no meat to-day, nor none shall eat;
Last night she slept not, nor to-night she shall not;
As with the meat, some undeserved fault1810
I'll find about the making of the bed;
And here I'll fling the pillow, there the bolster,
This way the coverlet, another way the sheets;
Ay, and amid this hurly I intend
That all is done in reverend care of her-1815
And, in conclusion, she shall watch all night;
And if she chance to nod I'll rail and brawl
And with the clamour keep her still awake.
This is a way to kill a wife with kindness,
And thus I'll curb her mad and headstrong humour.1820
He that knows better how to tame a shrew,
Now let him speak; 'tis charity to show. Exit

Enter TRANIO as LUCENTIO, and HORTENSIO as LICIO

Tranio. Is 't possible, friend Licio, that Mistress Bianca
Doth fancy any other but Lucentio?1825
I tell you, sir, she bears me fair in hand.
Hortensio. Sir, to satisfy you in what I have said,
Stand by and mark the manner of his teaching.
[They stand aside]

Enter BIANCA, and LUCENTIO as CAMBIO

Lucentio. Now, mistress, profit you in what you read?
Bianca. What, master, read you, First resolve me that.
Lucentio. I read that I profess, 'The Art to Love.'
Bianca. And may you prove, sir, master of your art!
Lucentio. While you, sweet dear, prove mistress of my heart.1835
[They retire]

Hortensio. Quick proceeders, marry! Now tell me, I pray,
You that durst swear that your Mistress Bianca
Lov'd none in the world so well as Lucentio.
Tranio. O despiteful love! unconstant womankind!1840
I tell thee, Licio, this is wonderful.
Hortensio. Mistake no more; I am not Licio.
Nor a musician as I seem to be;
But one that scorn to live in this disguise
For such a one as leaves a gentleman1845
And makes a god of such a cullion.
Know, sir, that I am call'd Hortensio.
Tranio. Signior Hortensio, I have often heard
Of your entire affection to Bianca;
And since mine eyes are witness of her lightness,1850
I will with you, if you be so contented,
Forswear Bianca and her love for ever.
Hortensio. See, how they kiss and court! Signior Lucentio,
Here is my hand, and here I firmly vow
Never to woo her more, but do forswear her,1855
As one unworthy all the former favours
That I have fondly flatter'd her withal.
Tranio. And here I take the like unfeigned oath,
Never to marry with her though she would entreat;
Fie on her! See how beastly she doth court him!1860
Hortensio. Would all the world but he had quite forsworn!
For me, that I may surely keep mine oath,
I will be married to a wealtlly widow
Ere three days pass, which hath as long lov'd me
As I have lov'd this proud disdainful haggard.1865
And so farewell, Signior Lucentio.
Kindness in women, not their beauteous looks,
Shall win my love; and so I take my leave,
In resolution as I swore before. Exit
Tranio. Mistress Bianca, bless you with such grace1870
As 'longeth to a lover's blessed case!
Nay, I have ta'en you napping, gentle love,
And have forsworn you with Hortensio.
Bianca. Tranio, you jest; but have you both forsworn me?
Tranio. Mistress, we have.1875
Lucentio. Then we are rid of Licio.
Tranio. I' faith, he'll have a lusty widow now,
That shall be woo'd and wedded in a day.
Bianca. God give him joy!
Tranio. Ay, and he'll tame her.1880
Bianca. He says so, Tranio.
Tranio. Faith, he is gone unto the taming-school.
Bianca. The taming-school! What, is there such a place?
Tranio. Ay, mistress; and Petruchio is the master,
That teacheth tricks eleven and twenty long,1885
To tame a shrew and charm her chattering tongue.
Enter BIONDELLO

Biondello. O master, master I have watch'd so long
That I am dog-weary; but at last I spied
An ancient angel coming down the hill1890
Will serve the turn.
Tranio. What is he, Biondello?
Biondello. Master, a mercatante or a pedant,
I know not what; but formal in apparel,
In gait and countenance surely like a father.1895
Lucentio. And what of him, Tranio?
Tranio. If he be credulous and trust my tale,
I'll make him glad to seem Vincentio,
And give assurance to Baptista Minola
As if he were the right Vincentio.1900
Take in your love, and then let me alone.
Exeunt LUCENTIO and BIANCA

Enter a PEDANT

Pedant. God save you, sir!
Tranio. And you, sir; you are welcome.1905
Travel you far on, or are you at the farthest?
Pedant. Sir, at the farthest for a week or two;
But then up farther, and as far as Rome;
And so to Tripoli, if God lend me life.
Tranio. What countryman, I pray?1910
Pedant. Of Mantua.
Tranio. Of Mantua, sir? Marry, God forbid,
And come to Padua, careless of your life!
Pedant. My life, sir! How, I pray? For that goes hard.
Tranio. 'Tis death for any one in Mantua1915
To come to Padua. Know you not the cause?
Your ships are stay'd at Venice; and the Duke,
For private quarrel 'twixt your Duke and him,
Hath publish'd and proclaim'd it openly.
'Tis marvel- but that you are but newly come,1920
You might have heard it else proclaim'd about.
Pedant. Alas, sir, it is worse for me than so!
For I have bills for money by exchange
From Florence, and must here deliver them.
Tranio. Well, sir, to do you courtesy,1925
This will I do, and this I will advise you-
First, tell me, have you ever been at Pisa?
Pedant. Ay, sir, in Pisa have I often been,
Pisa renowned for grave citizens.
Tranio. Among them know you one Vincentio?1930
Pedant. I know him not, but I have heard of him,
A merchant of incomparable wealth.
Tranio. He is my father, sir; and, sooth to say,
In count'nance somewhat doth resemble you.
Biondello. [Aside] As much as an apple doth an oyster, and all1935
one.
Tranio. To save your life in this extremity,
This favour will I do you for his sake;
And think it not the worst of all your fortunes
That you are like to Sir Vincentio.1940
His name and credit shall you undertake,
And in my house you shall be friendly lodg'd;
Look that you take upon you as you should.
You understand me, sir. So shall you stay
Till you have done your business in the city.1945
If this be court'sy, sir, accept of it.
Pedant. O, sir, I do; and will repute you ever
The patron of my life and liberty.
Tranio. Then go with me to make the matter good.
This, by the way, I let you understand:1950
My father is here look'd for every day
To pass assurance of a dow'r in marriage
'Twixt me and one Baptista's daughter here.
In all these circumstances I'll instruct you.
Go with me to clothe you as becomes you. Exeunt1955

Enter KATHERINA and GRUMIO

Grumio. No, no, forsooth; I dare not for my life.
Katherina. The more my wrong, the more his spite appears.
What, did he marry me to famish me?
Beggars that come unto my father's door1960
Upon entreaty have a present alms;
If not, elsewhere they meet with charity;
But I, who never knew how to entreat,
Nor never needed that I should entreat,
Am starv'd for meat, giddy for lack of sleep;1965
With oaths kept waking, and with brawling fed;
And that which spites me more than all these wants-
He does it under name of perfect love;
As who should say, if I should sleep or eat,
'Twere deadly sickness or else present death.1970
I prithee go and get me some repast;
I care not what, so it be wholesome food.
Grumio. What say you to a neat's foot?
Katherina. 'Tis passing good; I prithee let me have it.
Grumio. I fear it is too choleric a meat.1975
How say you to a fat tripe finely broil'd?
Katherina. I like it well; good Grumio, fetch it me.
Grumio. I cannot tell; I fear 'tis choleric.
What say you to a piece of beef and mustard?
Katherina. A dish that I do love to feed upon.1980
Grumio. Ay, but the mustard is too hot a little.
Katherina. Why then the beef, and let the mustard rest.
Grumio. Nay, then I will not; you shall have the mustard,
Or else you get no beef of Grumio.
Katherina. Then both, or one, or anything thou wilt.1985
Grumio. Why then the mustard without the beef.
Katherina. Go, get thee gone, thou false deluding slave,
[Beats him]
That feed'st me with the very name of meat.
Sorrow on thee and all the pack of you1990
That triumph thus upon my misery!
Go, get thee gone, I say.
Enter PETRUCHIO, and HORTENSIO with meat

Petruchio. How fares my Kate? What, sweeting, all amort?
Hortensio. Mistress, what cheer?1995
Katherina. Faith, as cold as can be.
Petruchio. Pluck up thy spirits, look cheerfully upon me.
Here, love, thou seest how diligent I am,
To dress thy meat myself, and bring it thee.
I am sure, sweet Kate, this kindness merits thanks.2000
What, not a word? Nay, then thou lov'st it not,
And all my pains is sorted to no proof.
Here, take away this dish.
Katherina. I pray you, let it stand.
Petruchio. The poorest service is repaid with thanks;2005
And so shall mine, before you touch the meat.
Katherina. I thank you, sir.
Hortensio. Signior Petruchio, fie! you are to blame.
Come, Mistress Kate, I'll bear you company.
Petruchio. [Aside] Eat it up all, Hortensio, if thou lovest me.-2010
Much good do it unto thy gentle heart!
Kate, eat apace. And now, my honey love,
Will we return unto thy father's house
And revel it as bravely as the best,
With silken coats and caps, and golden rings,2015
With ruffs and cuffs and farthingales and things,
With scarfs and fans and double change of brav'ry.
With amber bracelets, beads, and all this knav'ry.
What, hast thou din'd? The tailor stays thy leisure,
To deck thy body with his ruffling treasure.2020
[Enter TAILOR]
Come, tailor, let us see these ornaments;
Lay forth the gown.
[Enter HABERDASHER]
What news with you, sir?2025
Haberdasher. Here is the cap your worship did bespeak.
Petruchio. Why, this was moulded on a porringer;
A velvet dish. Fie, fie! 'tis lewd and filthy;
Why, 'tis a cockle or a walnut-shell,
A knack, a toy, a trick, a baby's cap.2030
Away with it. Come, let me have a bigger.
Katherina. I'll have no bigger; this doth fit the time,
And gentlewomen wear such caps as these.
Petruchio. When you are gentle, you shall have one too,
And not till then.2035
Hortensio. [Aside] That will not be in haste.
Katherina. Why, sir, I trust I may have leave to speak;
And speak I will. I am no child, no babe.
Your betters have endur'd me say my mind,
And if you cannot, best you stop your ears.2040
My tongue will tell the anger of my heart,
Or else my heart, concealing it, will break;
And rather than it shall, I will be free
Even to the uttermost, as I please, in words.
Petruchio. Why, thou say'st true; it is a paltry cap,2045
A custard-coffin, a bauble, a silken pie;
I love thee well in that thou lik'st it not.
Katherina. Love me or love me not, I like the cap;
And it I will have, or I will have none. Exit HABERDASHER
Petruchio. Thy gown? Why, ay. Come, tailor, let us see't.2050
O mercy, God! what masquing stuff is here?
What's this? A sleeve? 'Tis like a demi-cannon.
What, up and down, carv'd like an appletart?
Here's snip and nip and cut and slish and slash,
Like to a censer in a barber's shop.2055
Why, what a devil's name, tailor, call'st thou this?
Hortensio. [Aside] I see she's like to have neither cap nor gown.
Tailor. You bid me make it orderly and well,
According to the fashion and the time.
Petruchio. Marry, and did; but if you be rememb'red,2060
I did not bid you mar it to the time.
Go, hop me over every kennel home,
For you shall hop without my custom, sir.
I'll none of it; hence! make your best of it.
Katherina. I never saw a better fashion'd gown,2065
More quaint, more pleasing, nor more commendable;
Belike you mean to make a puppet of me.
Petruchio. Why, true; he means to make a puppet of thee.
Tailor. She says your worship means to make a puppet of her.
Petruchio. O monstrous arrogance! Thou liest, thou thread, thou2070
thimble,
Thou yard, three-quarters, half-yard, quarter, nail,
Thou flea, thou nit, thou winter-cricket thou-
Brav'd in mine own house with a skein of thread!
Away, thou rag, thou quantity, thou remnant;2075
Or I shall so bemete thee with thy yard
As thou shalt think on prating whilst thou liv'st!
I tell thee, I, that thou hast marr'd her gown.
Tailor. Your worship is deceiv'd; the gown is made
Just as my master had direction.2080
Grumio gave order how it should be done.
Grumio. I gave him no order; I gave him the stuff.
Tailor. But how did you desire it should be made?
Grumio. Marry, sir, with needle and thread.
Tailor. But did you not request to have it cut?2085
Grumio. Thou hast fac'd many things.
Tailor. I have.
Grumio. Face not me. Thou hast brav'd many men; brave not me. I
will neither be fac'd nor brav'd. I say unto thee, I bid thy
master cut out the gown; but I did not bid him cut it to pieces.2090
Ergo, thou liest.
Tailor. Why, here is the note of the fashion to testify.
Petruchio. Read it.
Grumio. The note lies in's throat, if he say I said so.
Tailor. [Reads] 'Imprimis, a loose-bodied gown'-2095
Grumio. Master, if ever I said loose-bodied gown, sew me in the
skirts of it and beat me to death with a bottom of brown bread; I
said a gown.
Petruchio. Proceed.
Tailor. [Reads] 'With a small compass'd cape'-2100
Grumio. I confess the cape.
Tailor. [Reads] 'With a trunk sleeve'-
Grumio. I confess two sleeves.
Tailor. [Reads] 'The sleeves curiously cut.'
Petruchio. Ay, there's the villainy.2105
Grumio. Error i' th' bill, sir; error i' th' bill! I commanded the
sleeves should be cut out, and sew'd up again; and that I'll
prove upon thee, though thy little finger be armed in a thimble.
Tailor. This is true that I say; an I had thee in place where, thou
shouldst know it.2110
Grumio. I am for thee straight; take thou the bill, give me thy
meteyard, and spare not me.
Hortensio. God-a-mercy, Grumio! Then he shall have no odds.
Petruchio. Well, sir, in brief, the gown is not for me.
Grumio. You are i' th' right, sir; 'tis for my mistress.2115
Petruchio. Go, take it up unto thy master's use.
Grumio. Villain, not for thy life! Take up my mistress' gown for
thy master's use!
Petruchio. Why, sir, what's your conceit in that?
Grumio. O, sir, the conceit is deeper than you think for.2120
Take up my mistress' gown to his master's use!
O fie, fie, fie!
Petruchio. [Aside] Hortensio, say thou wilt see the tailor paid.-
Go take it hence; be gone, and say no more.
Hortensio. Tailor, I'll pay thee for thy gown to-morrow;2125
Take no unkindness of his hasty words.
Away, I say; commend me to thy master. Exit TAILOR
Petruchio. Well, come, my Kate; we will unto your father's
Even in these honest mean habiliments;
Our purses shall be proud, our garments poor;2130
For 'tis the mind that makes the body rich;
And as the sun breaks through the darkest clouds,
So honour peereth in the meanest habit.
What, is the jay more precious than the lark
Because his feathers are more beautiful?2135
Or is the adder better than the eel
Because his painted skin contents the eye?
O no, good Kate; neither art thou the worse
For this poor furniture and mean array.
If thou account'st it shame, lay it on me;2140
And therefore frolic; we will hence forthwith
To feast and sport us at thy father's house.
Go call my men, and let us straight to him;
And bring our horses unto Long-lane end;
There will we mount, and thither walk on foot.2145
Let's see; I think 'tis now some seven o'clock,
And well we may come there by dinner-time.
Katherina. I dare assure you, sir, 'tis almost two,
And 'twill be supper-time ere you come there.
Petruchio. It shall be seven ere I go to horse.2150
Look what I speak, or do, or think to do,
You are still crossing it. Sirs, let 't alone;
I will not go to-day; and ere I do,
It shall be what o'clock I say it is.
Hortensio. Why, so this gallant will command the sun.2155

Enter TRANIO as LUCENTIO, and the PEDANT dressed like VINCENTIO

Tranio. Sir, this is the house; please it you that I call?
Pedant. Ay, what else? And, but I be deceived,
Signior Baptista may remember me2160
Near twenty years ago in Genoa,
Where we were lodgers at the Pegasus.
Tranio. 'Tis well; and hold your own, in any case,
With such austerity as longeth to a father.
Enter BIONDELLO

Pedant. I warrant you. But, sir, here comes your boy;
'Twere good he were school'd.
Tranio. Fear you not him. Sirrah Biondello,
Now do your duty throughly, I advise you.
Imagine 'twere the right Vincentio.2170
Biondello. Tut, fear not me.
Tranio. But hast thou done thy errand to Baptista?
Biondello. I told him that your father was at Venice,
And that you look'd for him this day in Padua.
Tranio. Th'art a tall fellow; hold thee that to drink.2175
Here comes Baptista. Set your countenance, sir.
[Enter BAPTISTA, and LUCENTIO as CAMBIO]
Signior Baptista, you are happily met.
[To To the PEDANT] Sir, this is the gentleman I told you of;
I pray you stand good father to me now;2180
Give me Bianca for my patrimony.
Pedant. Soft, son!
Sir, by your leave: having come to Padua
To gather in some debts, my son Lucentio
Made me acquainted with a weighty cause2185
Of love between your daughter and himself;
And- for the good report I hear of you,
And for the love he beareth to your daughter,
And she to him- to stay him not too long,
I am content, in a good father's care,2190
To have him match'd; and, if you please to like
No worse than I, upon some agreement
Me shall you find ready and willing
With one consent to have her so bestow'd;
For curious I cannot be with you,2195
Signior Baptista, of whom I hear so well.
Baptista Minola. Sir, pardon me in what I have to say.
Your plainness and your shortness please me well.
Right true it is your son Lucentio here
Doth love my daughter, and she loveth him,2200
Or both dissemble deeply their affections;
And therefore, if you say no more than this,
That like a father you will deal with him,
And pass my daughter a sufficient dower,
The match is made, and all is done-2205
Your son shall have my daughter with consent.
Tranio. I thank you, sir. Where then do you know best
We be affied, and such assurance ta'en
As shall with either part's agreement stand?
Baptista Minola. Not in my house, Lucentio, for you know2210
Pitchers have ears, and I have many servants;
Besides, old Gremio is heark'ning still,
And happily we might be interrupted.
Tranio. Then at my lodging, an it like you.
There doth my father lie; and there this night2215
We'll pass the business privately and well.
Send for your daughter by your servant here;
My boy shall fetch the scrivener presently.
The worst is this, that at so slender warning
You are like to have a thin and slender pittance.2220
Baptista Minola. It likes me well. Cambio, hie you home,
And bid Bianca make her ready straight;
And, if you will, tell what hath happened-
Lucentio's father is arriv'd in Padua,
And how she's like to be Lucentio's wife. Exit LUCENTIO2225
Biondello. I pray the gods she may, with all my heart.
Tranio. Dally not with the gods, but get thee gone.
[Exit BIONDELLO]
Signior Baptista, shall I lead the way?
Welcome! One mess is like to be your cheer;2230
Come, sir; we will better it in Pisa.
Baptista Minola. I follow you. Exeunt
Re-enter LUCENTIO as CAMBIO, and BIONDELLO

Biondello. Cambio.
Lucentio. What say'st thou, Biondello?2235
Biondello. You saw my master wink and laugh upon you?
Lucentio. Biondello, what of that?
Biondello. Faith, nothing; but has left me here behind to expound
the meaning or moral of his signs and tokens.
Lucentio. I pray thee moralize them.2240
Biondello. Then thus: Baptista is safe, talking with the deceiving
father of a deceitful son.
Lucentio. And what of him?
Biondello. His daughter is to be brought by you to the supper.
Lucentio. And then?2245
Biondello. The old priest at Saint Luke's church is at your command
at all hours.
Lucentio. And what of all this?
Biondello. I cannot tell, except they are busied about a
counterfeit assurance. Take your assurance of her, cum privilegio2250
ad imprimendum solum; to th' church take the priest, clerk, and
some sufficient honest witnesses.
If this be not that you look for, I have more to say,
But bid Bianca farewell for ever and a day.
Lucentio. Hear'st thou, Biondello?2255
Biondello. I cannot tarry. I knew a wench married in an afternoon
as she went to the garden for parsley to stuff a rabbit; and so
may you, sir; and so adieu, sir. My master hath appointed me to
go to Saint Luke's to bid the priest be ready to come against you
come with your appendix.2260
Exit

Lucentio. I may and will, if she be so contented.
She will be pleas'd; then wherefore should I doubt?
Hap what hap may, I'll roundly go about her;
It shall go hard if Cambio go without her. Exit2265

Enter PETRUCHIO, KATHERINA, HORTENSIO, and SERVANTS

Petruchio. Come on, a God's name; once more toward our father's.
Good Lord, how bright and goodly shines the moon!
Katherina. The moon? The sun! It is not moonlight now.
Petruchio. I say it is the moon that shines so bright.2270
Katherina. I know it is the sun that shines so bright.
Petruchio. Now by my mother's son, and that's myself,
It shall be moon, or star, or what I list,
Or ere I journey to your father's house.
Go on and fetch our horses back again.2275
Evermore cross'd and cross'd; nothing but cross'd!
Hortensio. Say as he says, or we shall never go.
Katherina. Forward, I pray, since we have come so far,
And be it moon, or sun, or what you please;
And if you please to call it a rush-candle,2280
Henceforth I vow it shall be so for me.
Petruchio. I say it is the moon.
Katherina. I know it is the moon.
Petruchio. Nay, then you lie; it is the blessed sun.
Katherina. Then, God be bless'd, it is the blessed sun;2285
But sun it is not, when you say it is not;
And the moon changes even as your mind.
What you will have it nam'd, even that it is,
And so it shall be so for Katherine.
Hortensio. Petruchio, go thy ways, the field is won.2290
Petruchio. Well, forward, forward! thus the bowl should run,
And not unluckily against the bias.
But, soft! Company is coming here.
[Enter VINCENTIO]
[To VINCENTIO] Good-morrow, gentle mistress; where away?-2295
Tell me, sweet Kate, and tell me truly too,
Hast thou beheld a fresher gentlewoman?
Such war of white and red within her cheeks!
What stars do spangle heaven with such beauty
As those two eyes become that heavenly face?2300
Fair lovely maid, once more good day to thee.
Sweet Kate, embrace her for her beauty's sake.
Hortensio. 'A will make the man mad, to make a woman of him.
Katherina. Young budding virgin, fair and fresh and sweet,
Whither away, or where is thy abode?2305
Happy the parents of so fair a child;
Happier the man whom favourable stars
Allots thee for his lovely bed-fellow.
Petruchio. Why, how now, Kate, I hope thou art not mad!
This is a man, old, wrinkled, faded, withered,2310
And not a maiden, as thou sayst he is.
Katherina. Pardon, old father, my mistaking eyes,
That have been so bedazzled with the sun
That everything I look on seemeth green;
Now I perceive thou art a reverend father.2315
Pardon, I pray thee, for my mad mistaking.
Petruchio. Do, good old grandsire, and withal make known
Which way thou travellest- if along with us,
We shall be joyful of thy company.
Vincentio. Fair sir, and you my merry mistress,2320
That with your strange encounter much amaz'd me,
My name is call'd Vincentio, my dwelling Pisa,
And bound I am to Padua, there to visit
A son of mine, which long I have not seen.
Petruchio. What is his name?2325
Vincentio. Lucentio, gentle sir.
Petruchio. Happily met; the happier for thy son.
And now by law, as well as reverend age,
I may entitle thee my loving father:
The sister to my wife, this gentlewoman,2330
Thy son by this hath married. Wonder not,
Nor be not grieved- she is of good esteem,
Her dowry wealthy, and of worthy birth;
Beside, so qualified as may beseem
The spouse of any noble gentleman.2335
Let me embrace with old Vincentio;
And wander we to see thy honest son,
Who will of thy arrival be full joyous.
Vincentio. But is this true; or is it else your pleasure,
Like pleasant travellers, to break a jest2340
Upon the company you overtake?
Hortensio. I do assure thee, father, so it is.
Petruchio. Come, go along, and see the truth hereof;
For our first merriment hath made thee jealous.
Exeunt all but HORTENSIO

Hortensio. Well, Petruchio, this has put me in heart.
Have to my widow; and if she be froward,
Then hast thou taught Hortensio to be untoward. Exit

Enter BIONDELLO, LUCENTIO, and BIANCA; GREMIO is out before

Biondello. Softly and swiftly, sir, for the priest is ready.2350
Lucentio. I fly, Biondello; but they may chance to need the at
home, therefore leave us.
Biondello. Nay, faith, I'll see the church a your back, and then
come back to my master's as soon as I can.
Exeunt LUCENTIO, BIANCA, and BIONDELLO

Gremio. I marvel Cambio comes not all this while.
Enter PETRUCHIO, KATHERINA, VINCENTIO, GRUMIO, and ATTENDANTS

Petruchio. Sir, here's the door; this is Lucentio's house;
My father's bears more toward the market-place;
Thither must I, and here I leave you, sir.2360
Vincentio. You shall not choose but drink before you go;
I think I shall command your welcome here,
And by all likelihood some cheer is toward. [Knocks]
Gremio. They're busy within; you were best knock louder.
[PEDANT looks out of the window]

Pedant. What's he that knocks as he would beat down the gate?
Vincentio. Is Signior Lucentio within, sir?
Pedant. He's within, sir, but not to be spoken withal.
Vincentio. What if a man bring him a hundred pound or two to make
merry withal?2370
Pedant. Keep your hundred pounds to yourself; he shall need none so
long as I live.
Petruchio. Nay, I told you your son was well beloved in Padua. Do
you hear, sir? To leave frivolous circumstances, I pray you tell
Signior Lucentio that his father is come from Pisa, and is here2375
at the door to speak with him.
Pedant. Thou liest: his father is come from Padua, and here looking
out at the window.
Vincentio. Art thou his father?
Pedant. Ay, sir; so his mother says, if I may believe her.2380
Petruchio. [To VINCENTIO] Why, how now, gentleman!
Why, this is flat knavery to take upon you another man's name.
Pedant. Lay hands on the villain; I believe 'a means to cozen
somebody in this city under my countenance.
Re-enter BIONDELLO

Biondello. I have seen them in the church together. God send 'em
good shipping! But who is here? Mine old master, Vincentio! Now we
are undone and brought to nothing.
Vincentio. [Seeing BIONDELLO] Come hither, crack-hemp.
Biondello. I hope I may choose, sir.2390
Vincentio. Come hither, you rogue. What, have you forgot me?
Biondello. Forgot you! No, sir. I could not forget you, for I never
saw you before in all my life.
Vincentio. What, you notorious villain, didst thou never see thy
master's father, Vincentio?2395
Biondello. What, my old worshipful old master? Yes, marry, sir; see
where he looks out of the window.
Vincentio. Is't so, indeed? [He beats BIONDELLO]
Biondello. Help, help, help! Here's a madman will murder me.
Exit

Pedant. Help, son! help, Signior Baptista! Exit from above
Petruchio. Prithee, Kate, let's stand aside and see the end of this
controversy. [They stand aside]
Re-enter PEDANT below; BAPTISTA, TRANIO, and SERVANTS
Tranio. Sir, what are you that offer to beat my servant?2405
Vincentio. What am I, sir? Nay, what are you, sir? O immortal gods!
O fine villain! A silken doublet, a velvet hose, a scarlet cloak,
and a copatain hat! O, I am undone! I am undone! While I play the
good husband at home, my son and my servant spend all at the
university.2410
Tranio. How now! what's the matter?
Baptista Minola. What, is the man lunatic?
Tranio. Sir, you seem a sober ancient gentleman by your habit, but
your words show you a madman. Why, sir, what 'cerns it you if I
wear pearl and gold? I thank my good father, I am able to2415
maintain it.
Vincentio. Thy father! O villain! he is a sailmaker in Bergamo.
Baptista Minola. You mistake, sir; you mistake, sir. Pray, what do you
think is his name?
Vincentio. His name! As if I knew not his name! I have brought him2420
up ever since he was three years old, and his name is Tranio.
Pedant. Away, away, mad ass! His name is Lucentio; and he is mine
only son, and heir to the lands of me, Signior Vicentio.
Vincentio. Lucentio! O, he hath murd'red his master! Lay hold on
him, I charge you, in the Duke's name. O, my son, my son! Tell2425
me, thou villain, where is my son, Lucentio?
Tranio. Call forth an officer.
[Enter one with an OFFICER]
Carry this mad knave to the gaol. Father Baptista, I charge you
see that he be forthcoming.2430
Vincentio. Carry me to the gaol!
Gremio. Stay, Officer; he shall not go to prison.
Baptista Minola. Talk not, Signior Gremio; I say he shall go to prison.
Gremio. Take heed, Signior Baptista, lest you be cony-catch'd in
this business; I dare swear this is the right Vincentio.2435
Pedant. Swear if thou dar'st.
Gremio. Nay, I dare not swear it.
Tranio. Then thou wert best say that I am not Lucentio.
Gremio. Yes, I know thee to be Signior Lucentio.
Baptista Minola. Away with the dotard; to the gaol with him!2440
Vincentio. Thus strangers may be hal'd and abus'd. O monstrous
villain!
Re-enter BIONDELLO, with LUCENTIO and BIANCA

Biondello. O, we are spoil'd; and yonder he is! Deny him, forswear
him, or else we are all undone.2445
Exeunt BIONDELLO, TRANIO, and PEDANT, as fast as may be

Lucentio. [Kneeling] Pardon, sweet father.
Vincentio. Lives my sweet son?
Bianca. Pardon, dear father.
Baptista Minola. How hast thou offended?2450
Where is Lucentio?
Lucentio. Here's Lucentio,
Right son to the right Vincentio,
That have by marriage made thy daughter mine,
While counterfeit supposes blear'd thine eyne.2455
Gremio. Here's packing, with a witness, to deceive us all!
Vincentio. Where is that damned villain, Tranio,
That fac'd and brav'd me in this matter so?
Baptista Minola. Why, tell me, is not this my Cambio?
Bianca. Cambio is chang'd into Lucentio.2460
Lucentio. Love wrought these miracles. Bianca's love
Made me exchange my state with Tranio,
While he did bear my countenance in the town;
And happily I have arrived at the last
Unto the wished haven of my bliss.2465
What Tranio did, myself enforc'd him to;
Then pardon him, sweet father, for my sake.
Vincentio. I'll slit the villain's nose that would have sent me to
the gaol.
Baptista Minola. [To LUCENTIO] But do you hear, sir? Have you married my2470
daughter without asking my good will?
Vincentio. Fear not, Baptista; we will content you, go to; but I
will in to be revenged for this villainy. Exit
Baptista Minola. And I to sound the depth of this knavery. Exit
Lucentio. Look not pale, Bianca; thy father will not frown.2475
Exeunt LUCENTIO and BIANCA

Gremio. My cake is dough, but I'll in among the rest;
Out of hope of all but my share of the feast. Exit
Katherina. Husband, let's follow to see the end of this ado.
Petruchio. First kiss me, Kate, and we will.2480
Katherina. What, in the midst of the street?
Petruchio. What, art thou asham'd of me?
Katherina. No, sir; God forbid; but asham'd to kiss.
Petruchio. Why, then, let's home again. Come, sirrah, let's away.
Katherina. Nay, I will give thee a kiss; now pray thee, love, stay.2485
Petruchio. Is not this well? Come, my sweet Kate:
Better once than never, for never too late. Exeunt

LUCENTIO’S house

     	 
---
Enter BAPTISTA, VINCENTIO, GREMIO, the PEDANT, LUCENTIO, BIANCA, PETRUCHIO, KATHERINA, HORTENSIO, and WIDOW. The SERVINGMEN with TRANIO, BIONDELLO, and GRUMIO, bringing in a banquet

Lucentio. At last, though long, our jarring notes agree;
And time it is when raging war is done2490
To smile at scapes and perils overblown.
My fair Bianca, bid my father welcome,
While I with self-same kindness welcome thine.
Brother Petruchio, sister Katherina,
And thou, Hortensio, with thy loving widow,2495
Feast with the best, and welcome to my house.
My banquet is to close our stomachs up
After our great good cheer. Pray you, sit down;
For now we sit to chat as well as eat. [They sit]
Petruchio. Nothing but sit and sit, and eat and eat!2500
Baptista Minola. Padua affords this kindness, son Petruchio.
Petruchio. Padua affords nothing but what is kind.
Hortensio. For both our sakes I would that word were true.
Petruchio. Now, for my life, Hortensio fears his widow.
Widow. Then never trust me if I be afeard.2505
Petruchio. YOU are very sensible, and yet you miss my sense:
I mean Hortensio is afeard of you.
Widow. He that is giddy thinks the world turns round.
Petruchio. Roundly replied.
Katherina. Mistress, how mean you that?2510
Widow. Thus I conceive by him.
Petruchio. Conceives by me! How likes Hortensio that?
Hortensio. My widow says thus she conceives her tale.
Petruchio. Very well mended. Kiss him for that, good widow.
Katherina. 'He that is giddy thinks the world turns round.'2515
I pray you tell me what you meant by that.
Widow. Your husband, being troubled with a shrew,
Measures my husband's sorrow by his woe;
And now you know my meaning.
Katherina. A very mean meaning.2520
Widow. Right, I mean you.
Katherina. And I am mean, indeed, respecting you.
Petruchio. To her, Kate!
Hortensio. To her, widow!
Petruchio. A hundred marks, my Kate does put her down.2525
Hortensio. That's my office.
Petruchio. Spoke like an officer- ha' to thee, lad.
[Drinks to HORTENSIO]

Baptista Minola. How likes Gremio these quick-witted folks?
Gremio. Believe me, sir, they butt together well.2530
Bianca. Head and butt! An hasty-witted body
Would say your head and butt were head and horn.
Vincentio. Ay, mistress bride, hath that awakened you?
Bianca. Ay, but not frighted me; therefore I'll sleep again.
Petruchio. Nay, that you shall not; since you have begun,2535
Have at you for a bitter jest or two.
Bianca. Am I your bird? I mean to shift my bush,
And then pursue me as you draw your bow.
You are welcome all.
Exeunt BIANCA, KATHERINA, and WIDOW

Petruchio. She hath prevented me. Here, Signior Tranio,
This bird you aim'd at, though you hit her not;
Therefore a health to all that shot and miss'd.
Tranio. O, sir, Lucentio slipp'd me like his greyhound,
Which runs himself, and catches for his master.2545
Petruchio. A good swift simile, but something currish.
Tranio. 'Tis well, sir, that you hunted for yourself;
'Tis thought your deer does hold you at a bay.
Baptista Minola. O, O, Petruchio! Tranio hits you now.
Lucentio. I thank thee for that gird, good Tranio.2550
Hortensio. Confess, confess; hath he not hit you here?
Petruchio. 'A has a little gall'd me, I confess;
And, as the jest did glance away from me,
'Tis ten to one it maim'd you two outright.
Baptista Minola. Now, in good sadness, son Petruchio,2555
I think thou hast the veriest shrew of all.
Petruchio. Well, I say no; and therefore, for assurance,
Let's each one send unto his wife,
And he whose wife is most obedient,
To come at first when he doth send for her,2560
Shall win the wager which we will propose.
Hortensio. Content. What's the wager?
Lucentio. Twenty crowns.
Petruchio. Twenty crowns?
I'll venture so much of my hawk or hound,2565
But twenty times so much upon my wife.
Lucentio. A hundred then.
Hortensio. Content.
Petruchio. A match! 'tis done.
Hortensio. Who shall begin?2570
Lucentio. That will I.
Go, Biondello, bid your mistress come to me.
Biondello. I go. Exit
Baptista Minola. Son, I'll be your half Bianca comes.
Lucentio. I'll have no halves; I'll bear it all myself.2575
[Re-enter BIONDELLO]
How now! what news?
Biondello. Sir, my mistress sends you word
That she is busy and she cannot come.
Petruchio. How! She's busy, and she cannot come!2580
Is that an answer?
Gremio. Ay, and a kind one too.
Pray God, sir, your wife send you not a worse.
Petruchio. I hope better.
Hortensio. Sirrah Biondello, go and entreat my wife2585
To come to me forthwith. Exit BIONDELLO
Petruchio. O, ho! entreat her!
Nay, then she must needs come.
Hortensio. I am afraid, sir,
Do what you can, yours will not be entreated.2590
[Re-enter BIONDELLO]
Now, where's my wife?
Biondello. She says you have some goodly jest in hand:
She will not come; she bids you come to her.
Petruchio. Worse and worse; she will not come! O vile,2595
Intolerable, not to be endur'd!
Sirrah Grumio, go to your mistress;
Say I command her come to me. Exit GRUMIO
Hortensio. I know her answer.
Petruchio. What?2600
Hortensio. She will not.
Petruchio. The fouler fortune mine, and there an end.
Re-enter KATHERINA

Baptista Minola. Now, by my holidame, here comes Katherina!
Katherina. What is your sir, that you send for me?2605
Petruchio. Where is your sister, and Hortensio's wife?
Katherina. They sit conferring by the parlour fire.
Petruchio. Go, fetch them hither; if they deny to come.
Swinge me them soundly forth unto their husbands.
Away, I say, and bring them hither straight.2610
[Exit KATHERINA]

Lucentio. Here is a wonder, if you talk of a wonder.
Hortensio. And so it is. I wonder what it bodes.
Petruchio. Marry, peace it bodes, and love, and quiet life,
An awful rule, and right supremacy;2615
And, to be short, what not that's sweet and happy.
Baptista Minola. Now fair befall thee, good Petruchio!
The wager thou hast won; and I will add
Unto their losses twenty thousand crowns;
Another dowry to another daughter,2620
For she is chang'd, as she had never been.
Petruchio. Nay, I will win my wager better yet,
And show more sign of her obedience,
Her new-built virtue and obedience.
[Re-enter KATHERINA with BIANCA and WIDOW]2625
See where she comes, and brings your froward wives
As prisoners to her womanly persuasion.
Katherine, that cap of yours becomes you not:
Off with that bauble, throw it underfoot.
[KATHERINA complies]

Widow. Lord, let me never have a cause to sigh
Till I be brought to such a silly pass!
Bianca. Fie! what a foolish duty call you this?
Lucentio. I would your duty were as foolish too;
The wisdom of your duty, fair Bianca,2635
Hath cost me a hundred crowns since supper-time!
Bianca. The more fool you for laying on my duty.
Petruchio. Katherine, I charge thee, tell these headstrong women
What duty they do owe their lords and husbands.
Widow. Come, come, you're mocking; we will have no telling.2640
Petruchio. Come on, I say; and first begin with her.
Widow. She shall not.
Petruchio. I say she shall. And first begin with her.
Katherina. Fie, fie! unknit that threatening unkind brow,
And dart not scornful glances from those eyes2645
To wound thy lord, thy king, thy governor.
It blots thy beauty as frosts do bite the meads,
Confounds thy fame as whirlwinds shake fair buds,
And in no sense is meet or amiable.
A woman mov'd is like a fountain troubled-2650
Muddy, ill-seeming, thick, bereft of beauty;
And while it is so, none so dry or thirsty
Will deign to sip or touch one drop of it.
Thy husband is thy lord, thy life, thy keeper,
Thy head, thy sovereign; one that cares for thee,2655
And for thy maintenance commits his body
To painful labour both by sea and land,
To watch the night in storms, the day in cold,
Whilst thou liest warm at home, secure and safe;
And craves no other tribute at thy hands2660
But love, fair looks, and true obedience-
Too little payment for so great a debt.
Such duty as the subject owes the prince,
Even such a woman oweth to her husband;
And when she is froward, peevish, sullen, sour,2665
And not obedient to his honest will,
What is she but a foul contending rebel
And graceless traitor to her loving lord?
I am asham'd that women are so simple
To offer war where they should kneel for peace;2670
Or seek for rule, supremacy, and sway,
When they are bound to serve, love, and obey.
Why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth,
Unapt to toil and trouble in the world,
But that our soft conditions and our hearts2675
Should well agree with our external parts?
Come, come, you forward and unable worms!
My mind hath been as big as one of yours,
My heart as great, my reason haply more,
To bandy word for word and frown for frown;2680
But now I see our lances are but straws,
Our strength as weak, our weakness past compare,
That seeming to be most which we indeed least are.
Then vail your stomachs, for it is no boot,
And place your hands below your husband's foot;2685
In token of which duty, if he please,
My hand is ready, may it do him ease.
Petruchio. Why, there's a wench! Come on, and kiss me, Kate.
Lucentio. Well, go thy ways, old lad, for thou shalt ha't.
Vincentio. 'Tis a good hearing when children are toward.2690
Lucentio. But a harsh hearing when women are froward.
Petruchio. Come, Kate, we'll to bed.
We three are married, but you two are sped.
[To LUCENTIO] 'Twas I won the wager, though you hit the white;
And being a winner, God give you good night!2695
[Exeunt PETRUCHIO and KATHERINA]

Hortensio. Now go thy ways; thou hast tam'd a curst shrow.
Lucentio. 'Tis a wonder, by your leave, she will be tam'd so.
[Exeunt]
