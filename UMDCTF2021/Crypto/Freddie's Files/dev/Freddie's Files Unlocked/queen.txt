Never knew no good from bad
It's all decided for us
A young fighter screaming, with no time for doubt
Still come back to you (still come back to you)
Because I'm easy come, easy go,
I want it all yeah yeah yeah
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters
I can't get used to, living without, living without,
A little piece of you is falling away
I will destroy any man who dares abuse my trust
Too many bitter tears are raining down on me
Waving your banner all over the place
Pressure
This world has only one sweet moment
Flash, ah
But their beauty and their style
Can't we give ourselves one more chance?
God knows, got to make it on my own
Another one bites the dust ow
I consider it a challenge before
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
I wanna make a supersonic man out of you
Pressing down on you, no man ask for
For your truth it's all the same (oh no oh no)
This is our last dance
Yet tips 'em 'way from us
Have a good time, good time
Ee do ba be
I challenge the mighty titan and his troubadours
What the hell we fighting for?
I feel alive
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow,
Um bo bo
Went kind of smooth after a while
Caught in a landside,
I was just a skinny lad
(Don't stop me)
Little high, little low,
Fastidious and precise
Ee da ba ba ba
So you think you can love me and leave me to die
'Cause I'm having a good time, having a good time
Living without you by my side
Saviour of the universe
Nothing really matters to me
Easy come, easy go, will you let me go
And love (people on streets) dares you to change our way of
With a mighty flash
To absolutely drive you wild, wild
Thunderbolts and lightning, very, very frightening me
Puts people on streets
Ooh, you make me live now, honey
Somebody better put you back into your place, do it!
Repeating to the sound of the beat
Build your muscles as your body decays yeah
You brought me fame and fortune
Da-da-da-ha
I want it all, I want it all, I want it all, and I want it now
Like a tiger defying the laws of gravity
You're my best friend
To avoid complications
I'm just the shadow of the man I used to be
Left alone with big fat Fanny
In my tangled state of mind
I want, I want, I want, I want to break free
Sat on a fence but it don't work
Ooh, you make me live
In the end
Nothing really matters,
You know it's time for the Hammer To Fall
Who wants to live forever?
Oh, you gonna let it all hang out
I can't get over the way you love me like you do
Shoot out
It comes to you as to us all
Hey big woman, you made a bad boy out of me
And you won't understand why
Then again incidentally
She spoke just like a baroness
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
I am a satellite I'm out of control
If you wanna have a good time just give me a call
And kicked me out on my own
Scaramouch, Scaramouch, will you do the Fandango!
Turned away from it all like a blind man
I'm just the pieces of the man I used to be
Oh how I want to be free,
And everything that goes with it
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
I'm floating around in ecstasy
Make the bed light the light
What plaything can you offer me today?
I want to break free, Yeah
We will, we will rock you, one more time
Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger,
I'm having such a good time
You're so self satisfied I don't need you
Is this the real life?
Are you hanging on the edge of your seat?
There's no place for us
While you're waiting for the Hammer To Fall
Oh oh yeah yeah ha ha ha ha ha
Who waits forever anyway?
Didn't mean to make you cry,
And bad mistakes
Kicked in my face
'Cause we are the champions of the World
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, explode
La-da-da-da-dah
Set aside for us
Let's go
I'm burnin' through the sky, yeah
Time after time
Why can't we give love that one more chance?
Now he's dead
Here's to the future for the dreams of youth
I thank you all
Wanna try?
I want it all
Another one bites the dust haaaa
Perfume came naturally from Paris (naturally)
There are plenty of ways that you can hurt a man
Convinced our voices can't be heard
Oh take it - Bite the dust bite the dust
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here
Galileo, Figaro - magnificoo
It's the terror of knowing what the world is about
Insatiable an appetite
It's gonna fall
Don't hear the bell but you answer the call
Give it to me one more time
That my feelings are true
This is ourselves under pressure
There's no stopping me
We will, we will rock you
200 degrees
Chipping around, kick my brains around the floor
Through your window pane (oh no)
I'm a shooting star leaping through the sky
Gotta find me a future move out of my way
I wanna make a supersonic woman of you
Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to
Oh down beside that red fire light
The time
Buddy, you're a young man, hard man
While your waiting for the hammer to Hammer To Fall
Just give me a call
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me,
And come out alive
We're just waiting
I don't want to stop at all
Give love, give love, give love, give love, give love?
And my curtain calls
So you think you can stop me and spit in my eye
To the sound of the beat look out
Begone with you short and shady senators
That's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit
I want it, I want it
And another one gone and another one gone
When he's down
Day day de mm hm
(Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go
Here's to the future
Oh, you're the first one when things turn out bad
And bring him to the ground
Shouting in the street, gonna take on the world someday
Can't you see that it's impossible to choose
Listen all you people, come gather round
Whenever this world is cruel to me
Oh, I'm burnin' through the sky, yeah
There's no chance for us
We just wanna scream it louder and louder louder
Mister do or else die
So much to do in one lifetime (people do you hear me)
It'll make your life a lie
Too late, my time has come,
Just like Marie Antoinette
I've paid my dues
You don't waste no time at all
We'll destroy this Earth
When love must die
(Let me go) Will not let you go
I don't want to die,
Just surrender and it won't hurt at all
But it's been no bed of roses
Drop of a hat she's as willing as
Pray tomorrow gets me higher, high
Dum bum ba be
Insanity laughs under pressure we're breaking
Um ba ba be
Don't stop me, don't stop me
We will, we will rock you, yeah, yeah, come on
Get on your bikes and ride
Love, love, love, love, love
She's all out to get you
I want to break free
"Let me out!"
Forever is our today
I've fallen in love for the first time
I'm having a ball
She's a Killer Queen
Hey Another one bites the dust
Ee da de da de da de da
Till one day they call your name
Lady mercy won't be home tonight yeah
Ooh, I've been wandering 'round
Oh, and you give it all you got
Under pressure that burns a building down
Just killed a man,
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
I want it all (yeah)
Recommended at the price
Another one bites the dust
People on streets
But here it comes again
I'll take you to the seven seas of Rhye
And the pain will make you crazy
Can you hear me you peers and privy councillors
You just got time to say your prayers
Here we stand or here we fall
Steve walks warily down the street
'Let me out'
I've seen every blue eyed floozy on the way
Mamaaa,
But just give me, huh, what I know is mine
You're my sunshine and I want you to know
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh how I want to be free, Baby
And with a smile
People do you hear me, just gimme the sign
I want to break free from your lies
You got mud on your face, you big disgrace
Splits a family in two
And we mean to go on and on and on and on
Take me to them naughty ladies every time
I've fallen in love
Buddy, you're a boy, make a big noise
Don't stop me, hey, hey, hey
She was such a naughty nanny
I gotta get me a game plan, gotta shake you to the ground
No pleasure cruise
A built-in remedy
We will, we will rock you, yeah
I really love the things that you do
But I knew love before I left my nursery
Look up to the skies and see,
Ain't no sound but the sound of his feet
Ee da de da de
You can't decline
History won't care at all
Then momentarily out of action
By flash and thunder fire I'll survive
So I'm living it all, yes I'm living it all
Mamaaa, life had just begun,
I'm happy, happy at home
Torn between the lover and the love you leave behind
And the world I'll turn it inside out, yeah
When I walk out that door
Oh
Then I'll get you
She never kept the same address
In her pretty cabinet
Oh, you're my best friend, oh
Oh, down beside that red fire light
Extraordinarily nice
On a collision course
How do you think I'm going to get along
I swear that you'll be mine
Yes, I'm havin' a good time
I want it all hey
I've made a few
Guaranteed to blow your mind
Klytus I'm bored
Rich or poor or famous
Caviar and cigarettes
Any way the wind blows...
The people on the edge of the night
And this time I know it's for real
He's just a poor boy from a poor family,
Just an alley creeper, light on his feet
It ain't much I'm asking, if you want the truth
Yes too much love will kill you
Too much love will kill you every time
For Khrushchev and Kennedy
Baby now your struggle's all in vain
Are you happy are you satisfied?
Mama, oooh
Hey
(Let me go) (Never) let you go (Let me go) Ah
How would it be if you were standing in my shoes
How long can you stand the heat
Now I got mortgages and homes
Oh, I feel like no-one ever told the truth to me
Oh how I want to break free.
And I've been facing this alone for much too long
Not a man for compromise and where's and why's and living lies
Ha-da-da, ha-da-da-ah
Pressure pushing down on me
There's no time for us
No there's no making sense of it
Make you plead and scream and crawl
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
You know I'll never be lonely
And I love the things
Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all
You're headed for disaster 'cos you never read the signs
Oh, you're my best friend
Who dares to love forever? (Oh, whoa!)
I've got to break free
We will, we will rock you, sing it!
You got blood on your face, you big disgrace
Every way I go I'm bound to lose, oh yeah
She keeps her Moet et Chandon
Flash, ah
Then I'll defy the laws of nature
Playful as a pussy cat
Most impactive, your Majesty
I've been with you such a long time
Ooh shoot out
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy,
(Let me go)(Never) Never let you go
But life still goes on
I've been looking back to find where I went wrong
And I want it (now)
Met a man from China
I descend upon your earth from the skies
Under pressure
Yeah, I'm a rocket ship on my way to Mars
Now all I ever do is bring you down, oooh
Playing in the street, gonna be a big man someday
Why, why, why?
It's strange but it's true
Just as sure as none at all
It'll drain the power that's in you
I don't want to live alone, hey
But I have to be sure
God knows, God knows I've fallen in love.
Okay
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go,
I've got to break free.
And I'm giving it all, and I'm giving it all
Without you when you're gone
But I'm ready yes I'm ready for you
Nothing really matters, Anyone can see,
So baby can't you see
Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby,
Open your eyes,
In the shadow of the mushroom cloud
Ha-da-da, ha-ha-ha
Oh, you gonna take me home tonight
I'm a man with a one track mind
Bismillah! No, we will not let you go
We are the champions
I'm a racing car passing by like Lady Godiva
I'm standing on my own two feet
Oh mama mia, mama mia, mama mia, let me go
Adventure seeker on an empty street
You can treat him bad and leave him
It ain't much I'm asking, I heard him say
In the end.
These are the days it never rains but it pours
I see a little silhouetto of a man,
But committed no crime
Da da da ba ba
I am a sex machine ready to reload
Hey big woman you gonna make a big man out of me
Buddy, you're an old man, poor man
Oh, won't you take me home tonight
To the sound of the beat yeah
If you can't make up your mind
Toe your line and play their game yeah
You'd give your life you'd sell your soul
Sister I live and lie for you
I really love you
Oh ha
For we who grew up tall and proud
Dynamite with a laser beam
(Don't stop me now)
But lift your face the western way
Across the water, across the land
Touch my world with your fingertips
It's you you're all I see
You're my only one
I want it all, I want it all, I want it all and I want it now
I'm far away from home
Hammer, you know, Hammer To Fall
I'm travelling at the speed of light
The human race
But I've come through
I used to bring you sunshine
And we can love forever
Temporarily out of gas
I belong to you forever
But touch my tears with your lips
You are mine I possess you
No time for losers
Be lap
Pleading with your eyes, gonna get you some peace someday
You got mud on your face, big disgrace
For cars she couldn't care less
Ee day da, that's okay
Doo buh dum ba beh beh
He'll save every one of us
He's for every one of us
Ooh, you make me live, live, live, live
At the seven seas of Rhye
I got you to help me forgive
For meee
Still got my greatest treasure
God knows, God knows I want to break free.
Like an atom bomb about to
I want it all (yes I want it all)
So, (don't stop me now)
No escape from reality
Fear me you loathsome, lazy creatures
You're the victim of your crime
Oh, down beside your red fire light
Went down to Geisha Minah
We will, we will rock you, alright, louder!
And love dares you to care for
I got stiffness in the bones
Are you ready hey are you ready for this?
With his brim pulled way down low
For the Hammer To Fall
Mama, oooh,
'Cause love's such an old fashioned word
Don't stop me, don't stop me, ah
And it seems like there's no way out of this for me
Oh you gonna take me home tonight
Pressure on people, people on streets
He'll save with a mighty hand
Kicking your can all over the place, singin'
You can cheat him
I want it all, I want it all and I want it now
Bring before me what is mine
Yeah
Why can't we give love, give love, give love, give love
I'm just a poor boy nobody loves me
Machine guns ready to go
If you're that way inclined
What is this thing that builds our dreams
Caring about ourselves
Hey I'm gonna get you too
Every man, every woman, every child
Too much love will kill you
Another one bites the dust he he
Stands for every one of us
Ooh, ooh, ooh, I like it
We are the champions, my friends
(I'll survive, I'll survive)
With the pain and anger can't see a way out
Oh you gonna let it all hang out
You can beat him
I command your very souls you unbelievers
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all.
Storm the master marathon I'll fly through
In rain or shine, you've stood by me girl
You took me for everything that I had
Mmm num ba de
Keep coming up with love but it's so slashed and torn
And we'll keep on fighting till the end
Tonight I'm gonna have myself a real good time
Give out the good, leave out the bad evil cries
I want it all and I want it now
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
And we can have forever
Pray tomorrow gets me higher
If you wanna have a good time (alright)
Another one bites the dust yeah
And I ain't gonna lose
Oh, you're the best friend that I ever had
But I still get my pleasure
The inhabitants refer to it as the planet Earth
I want it all (give it all I want it all)
Is this just fantasy?
Watching some good friends screaming
Me, to me
I stand before you naked to the eyes
Galileo, Galileo
I've done my sentence
Well versed in etiquette
Ooh, you're my best friend
Gunpowder, gelatine
I'm happy at home (happy at home)
Who?
About growing up and what a struggle it would be
I've been singing with my band
Yeah too much love will kill you
You wanna try
Fat-bottomed girls you make the rocking world go round
I've taken my bows
Let the anaesthetic cover it all
Lock your door the rain is pouring
Anytime
Hear the cry of youth (hear the cry of youth) (hear the cry of youth)
Oh ev'ry night and every day
"Let them eat cake", she says
Ain't no beauty queens in this locality
I've fallen in love, yeah
Let loose, honey, all right
I've had my share of sand
I'm gonna go, go, go
Whatever this world can give to me
In conversation
'Cause I'm having a good time
At anytime an invitation
De day da
