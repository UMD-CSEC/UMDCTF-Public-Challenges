the Fremen without also speaking of their home

3
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:14,540
world of Arrakis. For much of their culture has

4
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:16,700
been built around adapting to the harsh

5
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:19,580
environment of their desert planet. The scarcity

6
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:19,760
of

7
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,180
water on Arrakis makes this world uninhabitable

8
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:26,480
for anyone unable to adapt. The Fremen have

9
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,180
evolved in this hostile environment, the lack of

10
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:32,060
water leading to great conservation skills and a

11
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:35,150
near worship of this life sustaining substance. A

12
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:38,450
core tenet of Fremen beliefs is that any given

13
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:39,620
individual's water

14
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:42,920

what wealth can you offer beyond the water in your

00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:49,640
flesh? The Fremen (ARE KEY) have also developed a

19
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:52,610
wide array of technologically advanced equipment

20
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:55,790
to help them thrive on Arrakis, such as the

21
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:59,210
stillsuits they wear to conserve and reclaim water

22
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:02,000
from the body, making their homes in the natural

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,940
caverns of the dry planet called cities. The

24
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:06,620

it is a key

31
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:23,060
component of their culture. The spice found on

32
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:25,640
Arrakis is a significant part of the

33
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:28,220
Fremen (ARE KEY) diet, contributing to their blue

34
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:31,940

35
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:35,480
largely seek to maintain distance from outside

36
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:38,720
political machinations, but this is not always

00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,290
possible

38
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,890

With their tight knit communities and specific
