# remove this if your challenge has no distributed files
# these files are taken from the same directory as the challenge.yaml
provide:
  - mentat-question
  - mentat-question.c
  - Dockerfile

# remove this if your challenge has no online component
# this default config will build the container using the
# Dockerfile in the current directory
#
# also: see example Dockerfile in chall-template
# feel free to replace with your own, but if making a simple challenge
# w/ nc connetion it's a good start
containers:
  main:
    build: .
    privileged: true
    ports:
      - 32300

# remove this if your challenge has no online component
# use either tcp/http
# this uses container name from above
expose: 
  main:
    - target: 32300
      tcp: 32300

# set these to true when your challenge is ready
# if you want to test your challenge, set deployed: true only, but
# be fast since your challenge is technically accessible by others
# if they guess url/port
visible: true
deployed: true
