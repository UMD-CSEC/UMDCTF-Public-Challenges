# bro thinks hes hans zimmer

Stilgar can't find his stillsuit after a night of too many spice beers!! He can only remember bits and pieces. He remembers one specific musician he really liked, and he's hoping finding him will lead him to the right place. We have intel that the musician operates at the pictured location. Help him remember so that he can get his suit back for a big wedding next month.

flag format is `UMDCTF{musician's name underscore separated}`, for example `UMDCTF{Frank_Sinatra}`
